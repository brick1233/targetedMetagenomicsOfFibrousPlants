		"abstract": "The components of flax (\n              Linum usitatissimum\n              ) stems are described and illustrated, with reference to the anatomy and chemical makeup and to applications in processing and products. Bast fiber, which is a major economic product of flax along with linseed and linseed oil, is described with particular reference to its application in textiles, composites, and specialty papers. A short history of retting methods, which is the separation of bast fiber from nonfiber components, is presented with emphasis on water retting, field retting (dew retting), and experimental methods. Past research on enzyme retting, particularly by the use of pectinases as a potential replacement for the current commercial practice of field retting, is reviewed. The importance and mechanism of Ca\n              2+\n              chelators with pectinases in retting are described. Protocols are provided for retting of both fiber-type and linseed-type flax stems with different types of pectinases. Current and future applications are listed for use of a wide array of enzymes to improve processed fibers and blended yarns. Finally, potential lipid and aromatic coproducts derived from the dust and shive waste streams of fiber processing are indicated.",

		"abstract": "SUMMARY\n            Subjective and objective methods were compared for the assessment of the quality of unretted and retted straw, and the fibres obtained after dew‐retting of four flax cultivars, Ariane, Evelin, Laura and Viola. Maturity of straw, degree of retting, ease of decortication after retting, divisibility, handle, cleanliness and colour were assessed as subjective factors and of these, degree of retting and handle appear to be useful for assessing quality. The samples were also analysed for physical and chemical differences using a range of objective methods. Straw quality could not be graded using height and maturity, although stem diameter and technical length could indicate quality. Changes in N, lipid and ash content, as a result of retting, were observed. The increase in the proportions of fibre fractions present in retted compared with unretted straw, due to microbial degradation of pectin, could be identified by thermal analysis. Analyses of the fibre samples to determine fineness, strength, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and minerals were carried out and significant differences in some of the parameters were identified. Cultivar Laura produced the best fibre. Fibre fineness, ash, lipid, caustic weight loss and fibre fractions as determined by thermal analysis were found to be important objective parameters for quality assessment. The assessment of fibre samples performed subjectively by an expert grader and by selected objective methods gave similar quality rankings.",

		"abstract": "Flax shive constitutes about 70% of the flax stem and has limited use. Because shive is a lignocellulosic by-product, it can potentially be pyrolyzed and activated to produce an activated carbon. The objective of this study was to create an activated carbon from flax shive by chemical activation in order to achieve significant binding of selected divalent cations (cadmium, calcium, copper, magnesium, nickel, zinc). Shive carbons activated by exposure to phosphoric acid and com-pressed air showed greater binding of cadmium, copper, nickel or zinc than a sulfuric acid-activated flax shive carbon reported in the literature and a commercial, wood-based carbon. Uptake of calcium from a drinking water sample by the shive carbon was similar to commercial drinking water filters that contained cation exchange resins. Magnesium removal by the shive carbon was greater than a commercial drinking water filtration carbon but less than for filters containing cation exchange resins. The results indicate that chemically activated flax shive carbon shows considerable promise as a component in industrial and residential water filtration systems for removal of divalent cations.",

		"abstract": "Lignin, a polyphenolic molecule, is a major constituent of flax shives. This polyphenolic molecular structure renders lignin a potential source of a variety of commercially viable products such as fine chemicals. This work compares the performance of different lignin isolation methods. Lignin from flax shive was isolated using both conventional alkaline extraction method and a novel experimental pressurized low polarity water (PLPW) extraction process. The lignin yields and chemical composition of the lignin fractions were determined. The conventional alkali treatment with 1.25 M NaOH, heated at 80 °C for 5 h, extracted 92 g lignin per kg flax shives, while lignin yields from the PLPW extracts ranged from 27 to 241 g lignin per kg flax shives. The purity and monomeric composition of the lignins obtained from the different extraction conditions was assessed via UV spectroscopy and alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation. Lignin obtained from conventional alkali treatment with 1.25 M NaOH, heated at 80 °C for 5 h was of low purity and exhibited the lowest yields of nitrobenzene oxidation products. With respect to alkali assisted PLPW extractions, temperature created an opposing effect on lignin yield and nitrobenzene oxidation products. More lignin was extracted as temperature increased, yet the yield of nitrobenzene oxidation products decreased. The low yield of nitrobenzene oxidation products may be attributed to either the formation of condensed structures or the selective dissolution of condensed structures of lignin during the pressurized alkaline high temperature treatment. Analytical pyrolysis, using pyroprobe GC-MS, was used to investigate the molecular composition of the lignin samples. The total yield of pyrolysis lignin products was 13.3, 64.7, and 30.5% for the 1.25 M NaOH extracted lignin, alkaline assisted PLPW extracted lignin, and the unprocessed flax shives, respectively. Key lignin derived compounds such as guaiacol, 4-vinyl guaiacol, 4-methyl guaiacol, syringol, eugenol, isoeugenol, catechol, homocatechol, and vanillin were detected in all of the samples.",

However, several factors have been reported to influence the fibers’ intrinsic properties, including a post-harvest process known as retting. This process plays a crucial role in facilitating the mechanical extraction of fibers from hemp stems. Retting involves the degradation of the amorphous components surrounding the fiber bundles enabling their decohesion from stems. Microorganisms play a central role in mediating this bioprocess. During retting, they colonize the stems’ surface. Therefore, the biochemical components of plant cell wall, acting as natural binding between fibers, undergo a breakdown through the production of microbial enzymes. Although its critical role, farmers often rely on empirical retting practices, and considering various biotic and abiotic factors, resulting in fibers with heterogenous properties. These factors limit the industrial applications of hemp fibers due to their inconsistent properties. Thus, the purpose of this review is to enhance our comprehension of how retting influences the dynamics of microbial communities and, consequently, the evolution of the biochemical properties of hemp stems throughout this process. Better understanding of retting is crucial for effective process management, leading to high-value fibers.\n              \n            \n            \n              Key points\n              \n                • Retting enables degradation of cell wall components, controlling fiber properties.\n              \n              \n                • Microbial enzymatic activity is crucial for successful decohesion of fiber bundles.\n              \n              \n                • Understanding retting mechanisms is essential for consistent fiber production\n                \n                  .",

		"abstract": "Field retting is an industrial process for extracting valuable bast fibres from hemp. In this study, molecular, chemical, and scanning electron microscopy studies were employed to understand the field retting mechanisms involving microbiota, including microbial community dynamics, hemp colonization, functions/interactions, and hemp biodegradation. This study for the first time revealed the coexistence of bacterial-fungal interactions during retting and showed progressive microbial breakdown of the stems. Using scanning electron microscopy, evidence for microbial activities/interactions within the stems was obtained, which helped to understand hemp retting mechanisms. The collective findings showed that: a) initially, easily accessible food within the hemp stems attracted and supported microbial invasion and decay, with activities influenced by the stem anatomy, chemistry, and morphology; b) filamentous fungi as key players in the early stages remarkably contributed to efficient fibre defibration; c) extended retting enhanced the bacterial activities, including bacterial-fungal interactions and their dominant role within the community; d) bacterial attraction and activities were promoted by bacterial mycophagy with a set of different phenotypic behaviours for nutrients and fungal highways for transport within the stems; and e) bast fibre degradation leading to inferior quality during prolonged retting was caused by ultrastructural modifications to all of the major fibre cell wall layers.",

As a powerful tool, HTS aids in identifying pathogens and enhances disease management strategies by detecting novel and emerging pathogens, tracking disease outbreaks, and contributing to developing disease-resistant cultivars. Despite these benefits, the implementation of HTS faces obstacles due to the complexity of data interpretation and economic factors that affect its widespread adoption. This comprehensive review summarizes the strengths, limitations, and opportunities associated with using HTS in managing plant diseases. The article also delves into the prospects of HTS, incorporating technological advancements, synergy with complementary methodologies, capacity-building initiatives, and the development of best practices and guidelines. By acknowledging and addressing these obstacles while harnessing the full capabilities of HTS, we advocate for a refined approach to managing plant diseases. This approach is critical for ensuring global food security, especially in the context of a growing global population and climate change.",

		"abstract": "Virtually all empirical ecological studies require species identification during data collection. DNA metabarcoding refers to the automated identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample containing entire organisms or from a single environmental sample containing degraded DNA (soil, water, faeces, etc.). It can be implemented for both modern and ancient environmental samples. The availability of next‐generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists’ need for high‐throughput taxon identification have facilitated the emergence of DNA metabarcoding. The potential power of DNA metabarcoding as it is implemented today is limited mainly by its dependency on PCR and by the considerable investment needed to build comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries. Further developments associated with the impressive progress in DNA sequencing will eliminate the currently required DNA amplification step, and comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries composed of whole organellar genomes and repetitive ribosomal nuclear DNA can be built based on the well‐curated DNA extract collections maintained by standardized barcoding initiatives. The near‐term future of DNA metabarcoding has an enormous potential to boost data acquisition in biodiversity research.",

In amplicon pyrosequencing studies of fungal diversity, one of the spacers\n              ITS\n              1 or\n              ITS\n              2 of the\n              ITS\n              region is normally used. In this methodological study we evaluate the usability of\n              ITS\n              1 vs.\n              ITS\n              2 as a\n              DNA\n              metabarcoding marker for fungi. We analyse three data sets: two comprising\n              ITS\n              1 and\n              ITS\n              2 sequences of known taxonomic affiliations and a third comprising\n              ITS\n              1 and\n              ITS\n              2 environmental amplicon pyrosequencing data. Clustering analyses of sequences with known taxonomy using the bioinformatics pipeline ClustEx revealed that a 97% similarity cut‐off represent a reasonable threshold for estimating the number of known species in the data sets for both\n              ITS\n              1 and\n              ITS\n              2. However, no single threshold value worked well for all fungi at the same time within the curated\n              UNITE\n              database, and we found that the Operational Taxonomic Unit (\n              OTU\n              ) concept is not easily translated into the level of species because many species are distributed over several clusters.

Although some groups are under‐ or unrepresented in the two data sets due to, e.g. primer mismatches, our results indicate that\n              ITS\n              1 and\n              ITS\n              2 to a large extent yield similar results when used as\n              DNA\n              metabarcodes for fungi.",

Restricted by current sequencing techniques, the massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons encompassing the full length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of the most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic classification is still debated. In the present study, several bioinformatics tools were integrated to build an\n                in silico\n                pipeline to evaluate the phylogenetic sensitivity of the hypervariable regions compared with the corresponding full-length sequences.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred from the geodesic distance, a parameter that is applied to quantitatively compare the topology of different phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from different sub-regions. The relationship between different sub-regions based on the geodesic distance indicated that V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the full-length 16S rRNA sequences in the phylogenetic analysis of most bacterial phyla, while V2 and V8 were the least reliable regions.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our results suggest that V4-V6 might be optimal sub-regions for the design of universal primers with superior phylogenetic resolution for bacterial phyla.

However, after a decade of use in these applications there is little consensus on the extent to which proportions of reads generated corresponds to the original proportions of species in a community. To quantify our current understanding, we conducted a structured review and meta‐analysis. The analysis suggests that a weak quantitative relationship may exist between the biomass and sequences produced (slope = 0.52 ± 0.34,\n              p\n               < 0.01), albeit with a large degree of uncertainty. None of the tested moderators, sequencing platform type, the number of species used in a trial or the source of DNA, were able to explain the variance. Our current understanding of the factors affecting the quantitative performance of metabarcoding is still limited: additional research is required before metabarcoding can be confidently utilized for quantitative applications. Until then, we advocate the inclusion of mock communities when metabarcoding as this facilitates direct assessment of the quantitative ability of any given study.",

The review considers approaches to field sampling, laboratory work, and bioinformatic analyses, with the aim of providing the background knowledge needed to make decisions at each step of a DNA metabarcoding workflow.\n            3. Although most conventional sampling methods can be adapted to DNA metabarcoding,  this review highlights techniques that will ensure suitable DNA preservation during field sampling and laboratory storage.

Accurate species detection with DNA metabarcoding needs to consider biases introduced during DNA extraction and PCR amplification, cross‐contamination resulting from inappropriate amplicon library preparation, and downstream bioinformatic analyses. Quantifying species abundance with DNA metabarcoding is in its infancy, yet recent studies demonstrate promise for estimating relative species abundance from DNA sequencing reads.\n            5.

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            DNA metabarcoding is subject to observation bias associated with PCR and sequencing, which can result in observed read proportions differing from actual species proportions in the DNA extract. Here, we amplify and sequence a mock community of known composition containing marine fishes and cetaceans using four different primer sets and a variety of PCR conditions. We first compare metabarcoding observations to two different sets of expected species proportions based on total genomic DNA and on target mitochondrial template DNA. We find that calibrating observed read proportions based on template DNA concentration is most appropriate as it isolates PCR amplification bias; calibration with total genomic DNA results in bias that can be attributed to both PCR amplification bias and differing ratios of template to total genomic DNA. We then model the remaining amplification bias and find that approximately 60% can be explained by inherent species‐specific DNA characteristics. These include primer‐template mismatches, amplicon fragment length, and GC content, which vary somewhat across Taq polymerases. Finally, we investigate how different PCR protocols influence community composition regardless of expected proportions and find that changing protocols most strongly influence the amplification of templates with primer mismatches. Our findings suggest that using primer‐template pairs without mismatches and targeting a narrow taxonomic group can yield more repeatable and accurate estimates of species' true, underlying DNA template proportions. These findings identify key factors that should be considered when designing studies that aim to apply metabarcoding data quantitatively.",

Here, we developed a method able to retroactively determine the error rate of most public sequencing datasets. To do this, we utilized the overlaps between reads that are a feature of many sequencing libraries. With this method, we surveyed 1943 different datasets from seven different sequencing instruments produced by Illumina. We show that among public datasets, the more expensive platforms like HiSeq and NovaSeq have a lower error rate and less variation. But we also discovered that there is great variation within each platform, with the accuracy of a sequencing experiment depending greatly on the experimenter. We show the importance of sequence context, especially the phenomenon where preceding bases bias the following bases toward the same identity. We also show the difference in patterns of sequence bias between instruments. Contrary to expectations based on the underlying chemistry, HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 share notable exceptions to the preceding-base bias. Our results demonstrate the importance of the specific circumstances of every sequencing experiment, and the importance of evaluating the quality of each one.",

In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.",

		"abstract": "Despite the routine use of standards and blanks in virtually all chemical or physical assays and most biological studies (a kind of “control”), microbiome analysis has traditionally lacked such standards. Here we show that unexpected problems of unknown origin can occur in such sequencing runs and yield completely incorrect results that would not necessarily be detected without the use of standards. Assuming that the microbiome sequencing analysis works properly every time risks serious errors that can be detected by the use of mock communities.\n          , \n            ABSTRACT\n            Mock communities have been used in microbiome method development to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification and sequencing and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the strong value of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed >2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded “normal” results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, we could have easily missed the problem had we not used the mock communities because of natural variation of microbiomes at our site. The “normal” results were validated over four MiSeqPE300 runs and three HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low. While validating these “normal” results, we also discovered that some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We strongly advise the use of mock communities in every sequencing run to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. The mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed to detect problems that show up only in some taxa and also to help validate clustering.\n            \n              IMPORTANCE\n              Despite the routine use of standards and blanks in virtually all chemical or physical assays and most biological studies (a kind of “control”), microbiome analysis has traditionally lacked such standards. Here we show that unexpected problems of unknown origin can occur in such sequencing runs and yield completely incorrect results that would not necessarily be detected without the use of standards. Assuming that the microbiome sequencing analysis works properly every time risks serious errors that can be detected by the use of mock communities.",

Using 21 mock communities composed of seven unicellular diatom and dinoflagellate algae, assembled with different composition and abundance by controlling the number of cells, we tested the accuracy of an eDNA metabarcoding protocol in reconstructing patterns of alpha and beta diversity. This approach allowed us to directly evaluate both qualitative and quantitative metabarcoding estimates. Our results showed non-negligible rates (17–25%) of false negatives (i.e., failure to detect a taxon in a community where it was included), for three taxa. This led to a statistically significant underestimation of metabarcoding-derived alpha diversity (Wilcoxon\n              p\n               = 0.02), with the detected species richness being lower than expected (based on cell numbers) in 8/21 mock communities. Considering beta diversity, the correlation between metabarcoding-derived and expected community dissimilarities was significant but not strong (R\n              2\n               = 0.41), indicating suboptimal accuracy of metabarcoding results. Average biovolume and rDNA gene copy number were estimated for the seven taxa, highlighting a potential, though not exhaustive, role of the latter in explaining the recorded biases. Our findings highlight the importance of mock communities for assessing the reliability of phytoplankton eDNA metabarcoding studies and identifying their limitations.",

Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy‐to‐use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams.\n            \n            \n              Methods and Findings\n              \n                We developed a free‐to‐use, Open Source R package and web‐based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web‐based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here;\n                https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/\n                .\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              \n                We have developed a user‐friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020‐compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (\n                https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma_flowdiagram/\n                ). This free‐to‐use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.",

At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low‐frequency, error‐prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by multiple sequence alignment and complete‐linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted OTUs and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2% single‐linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average‐linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected OTUs in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the OTU richness in environmental samples by as much as 30–60% but does not reduce the fraction of OTUs in long‐tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Motivation: Chimeric DNA sequences often form during polymerase chain reaction amplification, especially when sequencing single regions (e.g. 16S rRNA or fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer) to assess diversity or compare populations. Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments.\n            Results: We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus. UCHIME is &gt;100× faster than Perseus and &gt;1000× faster than ChimeraSlayer.\n            Contact:  robert@drive5.com\n            Availability: Source, binaries and data: http://drive5.com/uchime.\n            Supplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            \n              The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, a naïve Bayesian classifier, can rapidly and accurately classify bacterial 16S rRNA sequences into the new higher-order taxonomy proposed in Bergey's\n              Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes\n              (2nd ed., release 5.0, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 2004). It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98%) were of high estimated confidence (≥95%) and high accuracy (98%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at\n              http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/\n              .",

Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications.\n            \n              IMPORTANCE\n              The analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing has expanded our knowledge of the biogeography of microorganisms.

		"abstract": "The kinetics of the pH-induced dissociation of the 3 X 10(6) mol wt hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris (the earthworm) have been studied in a light-scattering stopped-flow apparatus. The ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a simple sequential model. The data for CO and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with Hb12 leads to 2Hb6 leads to 12Hb. Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb. In a sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species. Assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates. This assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7. When CO replaces O2 as the ligand, the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four. The met is about 20 times faster than the initial oxyhemoglobin dissociation rate, but perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer, the met rate was respectively 100 times and 500 times faster than that for the assumed hexameric forms of CO- and oxy-hemoglobin. The activation energies for the dodecamer to hexamer dissociation and for the dissociation of the hexamer to smaller forms were about 30 kcal/mol for oxy-, CO-, and methemoglobin.",
