ON THE OTHER HAND, RESIDUES ENCLOSED MAJOR CLASSES OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT COULD BE EXTRACTED AND USED ACROSS VARIOUS FIELDS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF THE ENDOGENOUS MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN THE LIGNOCELLULOSIC DEGRADATION OF HEMP RESIDUES FOR BIOREFINERIES OR OTHER INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES, SIMULTANEOUSLY CHARACTERIZING THE COMPOSITION OF THREE EXTRACTS RECOVERED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF MACERATION. THE PROCESS WAS EXAMINED FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES: PLANT TISSUE DEGRADATION AND MICROBIAL DYNAMICS WERE MONITORED USING HISTOLOGICAL, CULTURAL-DEPENDENT, AND INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS. EXTRACTS WERE CHARACTERIZED THROUGH FTIR, NMR, AND SDS-PAGE ANALYSES, ALSO EVALUATING THEIR POTENTIAL AS BIOSTIMULANTS FOR MICROBIAL GROWTH. RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE ENDOGENOUS PROKARYOTIC COMMUNITY REMAINED STABLE DURING THE MACERATION PERIOD, WHILE FLUCTUATIONS IN VARIOUS FUNGAL GENERA WERE OBSERVED. THE TAXONOMICAL COMPOSITION OF HEMP RESIDUES AT DIFFERENT STAGES MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE INCREASED ACCUMULATION OF AMIDE-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS, SUGARS, AND OTHER METABOLITES DETECTED IN LONG-TERM BIOCONVERSION. FINALLY, THE EXTRACTS RECOVERED FROM THE MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF HEMP RESIDUES WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THE YEAST   AND THE BACTERIUM   AS THE SOLE SOURCE OF NITROGEN, PAVING THE WAY FOR THEIR POTENTIAL USE AS BIOSTIMULANTS.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3390/ani15040514 Year: 2024</h1><p>VEGETABLE OILS RICH IN UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE ANIMAL HEALTH AND ENRICH MILK WITH FUNCTIONAL FATTY ACIDS IN VARIOUS STUDIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION WITH HEMP SEED OIL (HSO), A NATIVE VEGETABLE OIL FROM THE \""LONGEVITY VILLAGE\"" OF BAMA (GUANGXI, CHINA), ON THE MILK PERFORMANCE, MILK FATTY ACID COMPOSITION, BLOOD INDICATORS, AND RUMEN BACTERIAL COMMUNITY OF MILK-PRODUCING BUFFALO. SEVENTEEN HEALTHY, FOUR-YEAR-OLD, CROSSBRED, MILK-PRODUCING BUFFALOES WITH THE SAME PARITY (THREE), AS WELL AS SIMILAR BODY WEIGHTS (BW = 580 ± 25 KG), NUMBER OF DAYS PRODUCING MILK (DIM, 153 ± 10 D), AND MILK YIELDS (8.56 ± 0.89 KG/D) WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS (  = 6, 5, AND 6) AND ASSIGNED TO THE FOLLOWING DIETS: (1) NO HSO SUPPLEMENT (H0,   = 6), (2) A SUPPLEMENT OF 100 G/D OF HSO (H1,   = 5), AND (3) A SUPPLEMENT OF 200 G/D OF HSO (H2,   = 6). THE TOTAL EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD WAS 42 DAYS (INCLUDING A 14-DAY ADAPTATION PERIOD AND A 28-DAY TREATMENT PERIOD). THE DATA WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED TO THAT OF NO HSO SUPPLEMENT GROUP, THE DRY MATTER INTAKE (DMI) SHOWED A DECREASING TENDENCY (  = 0.06), WHILE FEED EFFICIENCY AND RUMEN FERMENTATION REMAINED SIMILAR ACROSS ALL THE GROUPS (  > 0.05) WITH DIETARY HSO SUPPLEMENTATION. MOREOVER, WITH DIETARY HSO SUPPLEMENTATION, THE TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (T-AOC) (  = 0.05) AND CATALASE (CAT) (  < 0.01) AND GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE (GSH-PX) (  = 0.02) CONTENTS IN THE SERUM WERE GREATLY INCREASED, WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OBSERVED IN THE H2 GROUP (INCREASED BY 1.16 U/ML, 1.15 U/ML, AND 134.51 U/ML, RESPECTIVELY). IN CONTRAST, THE MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) CONTENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITH DIETARY HSO SUPPLEMENTATION (  = 0.02) AND WAS THE LOWEST IN THE H1 GROUP (DECREASED BY 0.72 NMOL/ML). THE HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C) CONTENT IN THE BLOOD SHOWED AN INCREASING TENDENCY WITH DIETARY HSO SUPPLEMENTATION (  = 0.09). MOREOVER, WITH DIETARY HSO SUPPLEMENTATION, THE PROPORTIONS OF C18:0 (  = 0.02), C18:1N9T (  = 0.02), C18:2N6C (  = 0.02), C18:3N3 (  < 0.01), C18:2N9C (  = 0.04), OMEGA-3 (  = 0.02), AND OMEGA-6 (  = 0.02) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OBSERVED IN THE H2 GROUP (INCREASED BY 5.29 G/100 G FA, 1.81 G/100 G FA, 0.55 G/100 G FA, 0.14 G/100 G FA, 0.75 G/100 G FA, 0.17 G/100 G FA, AND 0.56 G/100 G FA, RESPECTIVELY). ADDITIONALLY, RUMEN   ABUNDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY HSO ADDITION (  = 0.03), WITH RUMEN   ABUNDANCE DECREASING IN THE H1 GROUP (BY 0.55%) AND INCREASING IN THE H2 GROUP (BY 0.73%). THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADDING HSO TO MILK-PRODUCING BUFFALO DIETS DOES NOT AFFECT FEED EFFICIENCY OR RUMEN FERMENTATION, ALTHOUGH IT DECREASES THE DMI. MEANWHILE, IT CAN IMPROVE THE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF MILK, ENHANCE THE ANTIOXIDANT STATUS, AND REGULATE BLOOD LIPID METABOLISM IN MILK-PRODUCING BUFFALOES.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3390/foods14030469 Year: 2025</h1><p>HEMP SEED FLOUR ( ) IS A NON-TRADITIONAL MATRIX ALTERNATIVE TO WHEAT FOR BAKED GOODS PRODUCTION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE MICROBIOTA OF TWO LIQUID SOURDOUGHS (SLS) BASED ON HEMP OR A WHEAT-HEMP MIXTURE, BEFORE AND AFTER SPONTANEOUS OR PILOTED FERMENTATION (  ITM21B OR   C43-11 USED AS STARTERS). CULTURE-DEPENDENT AND -INDEPENDENT (HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING OF BACTERIAL PHYLOGENETIC V3-V4 REGIONS OF THE 16S RRNA GENE) METHODS, WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. THE EFFECT OF FERMENTATION ON THE CONTENT OF BIOACTIVE MOLECULES (POLYPHENOLS, ORGANIC ACIDS, PROTEINS, AND AMINO ACIDS) WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY OF ALL SLS WAS MAINLY (99.7 ÷ 100%) COMPOSED OF   AND  , AND THE LATTER WAS THE UNIQUE PHYLUM BEFORE FERMENTATION IN FORMULATIONS PRODUCED EXCLUSIVELY WITH HEMP FLOUR. TWO PCOA PLOTS (TEST ADONIS WITH PSEUDO-F RATIO,   > 0.05) SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES OF THE FORMULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE VARIATION AT THE FAMILY LEVEL IN THE WHEAT-HEMP-BASED MIXTURE SLS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ENRICHMENT OF THE   FAMILY (KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST,   = 0.04). MOREOVER, RESULTS CONFIRMED HEMP SEED FLOUR AS A SUITABLE FERMENTATION SUBSTRATE TO OBTAIN MICROBIAL CONSORTIA ALLOWING FOR AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC ACIDS, ESPECIALLY LACTIC ACID (9.12 ± 1.22 AND 7.45 ± 0.75 MMOL/KG WITH   AND  , RESPECTIVELY), IN BOTH PILOTED FERMENTATIONS, AND IN POLYPHENOLS BY 21% AND AMINO ACIDS BY 158% IN SL FERMENTED BY THE C43-11 STRAIN.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3390/vetsci12010050 Year: 2024</h1><p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p><h1>: DOI-10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177851 Year: 2024</h1><p>INCREASING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT PLANTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS CAN ACTIVELY SEEK THE HELP OF MICROBES ('CRY-FOR-HELP' HYPOTHESIS). HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE UNDERLYING THIS STRATEGY IS LIMITED UNDER METAL-STRESS CONDITIONS. HERE, WE EMPLOYED INTEGRATED MICROBIAL COMMUNITY PROFILING IN CADMIUM (CD) POLLUTED SOIL AND CULTURE-BASED METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE THREE-WAY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE INDUSTRIAL HEMP (CANNABIS SATIVA L.), RHIZOSPHERIC MICROBES, AND CD STRESS. RESULTS FROM THE POT AND THREE CYCLES OF THE SUCCESSFUL HEMP PLANTING EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT CD STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPOSITION OF RHIZOSPHERE FUNGI IN INDUSTRIAL HEMP AND INDUCED ENRICHMENT OF THE FUNGAL OPERATIONAL TAXONOMIC UNIT (OTU)3 (CLADOSPORIUM). A REPRESENTATIVE OF OTU3 (STRAIN DM-2) WAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED. IN A HYDROPONIC EXPERIMENT, INOCULATION OF DM-2 SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SHOOT LENGTH (BY 25.84 %) AND FRESH WEIGHT (BY 92.66 %) OF HEMP SEEDLINGS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ABSENCE OF DM-2 UNDER THE CD STRESS. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT DM-2 INOCULATION COULD EFFECTIVELY ALLEVIATE THE CD STRESS IN HEMP SEEDLINGS. METABOLOMIC ANALYSIS OF SPENT MEDIA WITH OR WITHOUT DM-2 REVEALED THE ASSOCIATION OF DM-2 WITH THE TRANSFORMATION OF ROOT EXUDATES TO MELATONIN, WHICH MAY BE A KEY CHEMICAL IN PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS AGAINST ABIOTIC STRESSES. THE FINDINGS WILL INFORM EFFORTS TO MANIPULATE THE ROOT MICROBIOME TO ENHANCE PLANT GROWTH IN POLLUTED ENVIRONMENTS.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123039 Year: 2024</h1><p>THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ENHANCEMENT OF BIOGAS PRODUCTION FROM HEMP BIOMASS RESIDUE (HBR) THROUGH HYDROTHERMAL PRETREATMENT AND CO-DIGESTION WITH COW MANURE (CM). HYDROTHERMAL PRETREATMENT AT 200 °C FOR 15 MIN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE METHANE YIELD FROM 311.5 TO 434.3 ML-CH /G-VS  (P ≤ 0.05) FROM HBR AT 10% TOTAL SOLIDS (TS) LOADING, A 39% INCREASE. CO-DIGESTION WITH CM AT AN OPTIMUM RATIO OF 80:20 FURTHER INCREASED THE METHANE YIELD (738.7 ML-CH /G-VS ), REPRESENTING A 70% IMPROVEMENT OVER PRETREATED HBR ALONE AND A 137% INCREASE COMPARED TO UNTREATED HBR. MICROBIAL COMMUNITY ANALYSIS REVEALED THE DOMINANCE OF METHANOSAETA, COMPRISING 83-93% OF ARCHAEAL GENERA ACROSS SAMPLES. GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED ACETOCLASTIC METHANOGENESIS AS THE DOMINANT PATHWAY, ACCOUNTING FOR 80% OF METHANOGENESIS SEQUENCES. HYDROGENOTROPHIC METHANOGENESIS AND CO  REDUCTION WITH H  PATHWAYS CONTRIBUTED 10% EACH. THE OPTIMIZED PROCESS ACHIEVED A BIODEGRADATION EFFICIENCY OF 94% FOR HYDROTHERMALLY PRETREATED HBR, COMPARED TO 68% FOR UNTREATED HBR. MASS BALANCE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT COMBINING HYDROTHERMAL PRETREATMENT WITH ANAEROBIC DIGESTION INCREASED BIOGAS YIELD FROM 79% FOR UNTREATED HBR TO 86% FOR PRE-TREATED HBR (PHBR) CO-DIGESTED WITH CM. INTEGRATING HYDROTHERMAL PRETREATMENT AND CO-DIGESTION ENHANCES BIOGAS PRODUCTION FROM LIGNOCELLULOSIC AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES, CONTRIBUTING TO SUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3390/insects15100734 Year: 2024</h1><p>CORN STRAW IS CONSIDERED A RENEWABLE BIOMASS ENERGY SOURCE, AND ITS UNREASONABLE DISPOSAL LEADS TO RESOURCE WASTE AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. BLACK SOLDIER FLY (  L.) LARVAE (BSFL) FACILITATE THE BIOCONVERSION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF ORGANIC WASTES. IN THIS STUDY, WE FOUND THAT 88% OF BSFL SURVIVED, AND 37.4% OF CORN STRAW WAS DIGESTED AFTER 14 DAYS OF FEEDING WITH CORN STRAW. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, THE PRETREATMENT OF CORN STRAW WITH ALKALINE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE DID NOT PROMOTE ITS DIGESTION BUT RATHER REDUCED THE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL RATES OF BSFL.  ,  , AND UNCLASSIFIED   WERE THE ABUNDANT GENERA IN THE BSFL GUT FED WITH CORN STRAW. COMPARED WITH THE STANDARD DIET, THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM GENES, SUCH AS THE GENE ABUNDANCES OF Β-GLUCOSIDASE AND Α-GLUCOSIDASE, WERE HIGHER WITH CORN STRAW AS THE SUBSTRATE. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE GUT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COULD REGULATE SUITABLE AND FUNCTIONAL MICROORGANISMS IN RESPONSE TO THE SUBSTRATES. FURTHERMORE, FOUR CELLULASE-PRODUCING STRAINS, NAMELY  ,  ,  , AND  , WERE ISOLATED FROM THE GUTS OF CORN STRAW BSFL. THESE FOUR STRAINS HELPED INCREASE THE CONVERSION RATES OF CORN STRAW, THE WEIGHTS OF BSFL, AND SURVIVAL RATES. IN SUMMARY, WE REARED BSFL WITH CORN STRAW AND DISCOVERED THE FUNCTIONS OF GUT MICROORGANISMS IN ADAPTING TO THE SUBSTRATES. WE ALSO ISOLATED FOUR CELLULASE-PRODUCING STRAINS FROM THE BSFL GUTS AND DECLARED THE BENEFITS OF BSFL DIGESTING CORN STRAW.</p><h1>: DOI-10.7717/peerj.18116 Year: 2024</h1><p>KOMBUCHA IS TRADITIONALLY A NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE WHOSE PRODUCTION IS DEPENDENT ON CULTURE AND THE VARIOUS INGREDIENTS USED AS SUBSTRATES FOR FERMENTATION. THE GOAL OF OUR STUDY WAS TO APPLY HEMP LEAF AND MILKY MUSHROOM ( ) FLOUR AS FUNCTIONAL INGREDIENTS TO ENHANCE PHYTONUTRIENT QUALITY, ALONG WITH USING A MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM HIGHLY SYMBIOTIC WITH THESE INGREDIENTS. THE STUDY DETERMINED THE CONTENT OF PHYTONUTRIENTS (PHENOLIC AND FLAVONOIDS CONTENT), ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY THROUGH PERCENTAGE INHIBITION OF DPPH RADICAL SCAVENGING ACTIVITY (%), AND MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES CHANGES DURING FERMENTATION. THE MICROBIAL CHANGES WERE EVALUATED BY CELL VIABLE COUNT (TOTAL BACTERIA, LACTIC ACID BACTERIA, AND YEAST & MOLD) AND ITS IN PREPARED KOMBUCHA (USING RED TEA LEAVES, PANDAN LEAVES, AND SUCROSE) SUPPLEMENTED WITH FUNCTIONAL INGREDIENTS: T1 (HEMP LEAVES (CONTROL)) AND T2 (HEMP LEAVES WITH MILKY MUSHROOM FLOUR). THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM CHANGED DURING FERMENTATION. IN THE FIRST 7 DAYS, THE LEVELS OF YEAST AND MOLD INCREASED TO 6.17 AND 6.18 LOG CFU/ML, RESPECTIVELY. BY DAY 21, THE LEVELS OF BOTH T1 AND T2 CONTINUED TO RISE, REACHING 7.78 AND 7.82 LOG CFU/ML, RESPECTIVELY. THE VIABLE COUNT OF LACTIC ACID BACTERIA IN T1 AND T2 GRADUALLY INCREASED TO 6.79 AND 6.70 LOG CFU/ML, RESPECTIVELY, BY DAY 14. THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN A MARKED DECREASE IN PH VALUE, REACHING 3.63 AND 3.23 IN T1 AND T2, RESPECTIVELY, BY THE END OF THE PROCESS (21 DAYS). THE TOTAL BACTERIAL VIABLE COUNT DECREASED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE FERMENTATION TIME. DURING FERMENTATION, UNIQUE GENERA OF TEA FUNGUS OBSERVED IN T1 AND T2 WERE 64% AND 19%, RESPECTIVELY. AT THE BEGINNING (0 DAYS), THE TOP FIVE GENERA FOUND IN T1 WERE:   (25.91%),   (14.88%),   (7.81%),   (7.12%),   (6.63%), WHILE THE TOP FIVE GENERA IN T2 WERE   (94.55%),   (1.87%),   (0.77%),   (0.40%),   (0.38%). HOWEVER, ON DAY 21 (END OF THE PROCESS), IT WAS FOUND THAT   HAD THE HIGHEST RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN BOTH T1 AND T2. IN ADDITION, THE SUPPLEMENTATION OF THE TWO INGREDIENTS AFFECTED THE TOTAL PHENOLIC AND TOTAL FLAVONOID CONTENT OF THE TREATMENTS. AT THE END OF THE PROCESS, T2 SHOWED VALUES OF 155.91 MG GAE/ML FOR TOTAL PHENOLICS AND 1.01 MG CE/ML FOR TOTAL FLAVONOIDS, COMPARED TO T1, WHICH HAD 129.52 MG GAE/ML AND 0.69 MG CE/ML, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, THE DPPH INHIBITION WAS HIGHER IN T1 (91.95%) COMPARED TO T2 (91.03%). THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT KOMBUCHA FERMENTED WITH THESE INNOVATIVE INGREDIENTS EXHIBITED ENHANCED PHYTONUTRIENTS, AND SERVED AS SUBSTRATE FOR LAB AND TEA FUNGUS FERMENTATION, WHILE LIMITING THE GROWTH OF FUNGAL GENERA AND DIVERSITY OF MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3389/fpls.2024.1432875 Year: 2024</h1><p>OILSEED FLAX (  L.) YIELDS ARE PHOSPHATE (P) FERTILIZER-LIMITED, ESPECIALLY IN THE TEMPERATE SEMIARID DRYLAND REGIONS OF NORTH CHINA. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF P-FERTILIZER INPUTS ON PLANT GROWTH AND SOIL MICROORGANISMS IN FLAX PLANTING SYSTEMS. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, A FIELD EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED WITH FOUR TREATMENTS: NO P ADDITION AND APPLICATION OF 40, 80, AND 120 KG P HA , RESPECTIVELY. THE AIM WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS P FERTILIZER INPUTS ON YIELD, PLANT DRY MATTER, P USE EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS THE POPULATION OF SOIL ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI (AMF) AND BACTERIA IN DRYLAND OILSEED FLAX. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE P ADDITION INCREASED THE DRY MATTER, AND THE YIELD OF OILSEED INCREASED BY ~200% AT 120 KG P HA  ADDITION WITH INHIBITION ON THE GROWTH OF AMF HYPHAE. THE MODERATE P SUPPLY (80 KG HA ) WAS ADEQUATE FOR PROMOTING P TRANSLOCATION, P USE EFFICIENCY, AND P RECOVERY EFFICIENCY. SOIL PH, AVAILABLE P, AND AVAILABLE K SIGNIFICANTLY ( < 0.05) PROMOTED THE ABUNDANCE OF THE DOMINANT TAXA (  AND  ). IN ADDITION, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO COMPREHEND THE MECHANISM OF INTERACTION BETWEEN PHOSPHORUS-FERTILIZER INPUTS AND MICROBIOTA IN OILSEED FLAX SOIL. THIS NECESSITATES FURTHER RESEARCH TO QUANTIFY AND OPTIMIZE THE MODERATE PHOSPHORUS SUPPLY, REGULATE SOIL MICROBES TO ENSURE HIGH PHOSPHORUS UTILIZATION, AND ULTIMATELY ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM FOR OILSEED FLAX CULTIVATION IN THE LOCAL AREA.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1080/14786419.2024.2398733 Year: 2024</h1><p> L. ESSENTIAL OIL HAS ATTRACTED THE INTEREST OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THANKS TO ITS NUMEROUS BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED EOS AS ALTERNATIVE THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO LIMIT THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS; THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE   INHIBITORY AND BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY OF THE ESSENTIAL OILS OBTAINED FROM THE LEAVES AND INFLORESCENCES OF TWO HEMP GENOTYPES AGAINST TWENTY-ONE MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT, METHICILLIN-RESISTANT   STRAINS ISOLATED FROM CANINE CLINICAL SAMPLES. BOTH EOS WERE MAINLY REPRESENTED BY SESQUITERPENE HYDROCARBONS, WITH A PREVALENCE OF Β-CARYOPHYLLENE AND Α-HUMULENE. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT RELATIVE AMOUNTS OF PHYTOCANNABINOIDS WERE ALSO DETECTED. MICROBIOLOGICAL RESULTS EVIDENCED BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THE EO CHARACTERISED BY THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF PHYTOCANNABINOIDS, WHICH IN TURN SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES AMONG THE TESTED STRAINS. NEVERTHELESS, BOTH THE EOS SHOWED BETTER INHIBITORY AND BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITIES THAN THEIR MAIN CONSTITUENT, Β-CARYOPHYLLENE, TESTED INDIVIDUALLY, HIGHLIGHTING THE PRESENCE OF SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS AMONG THE EO COMPOUNDS.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3390/microorganisms12061189 Year: 2024</h1><p>DIFFERENT MODIFICATIONS OF THE STANDARD BREAD RECIPE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO IMPROVE ITS NUTRITIONAL AND HEALTH BENEFITS. HERE, WE UTILIZED THE   HUMAN GUT SIMULATOR (HGS) TO ASSESS THE FERMENTATION OF ONE SUCH ARTISAN BREAD BY HUMAN GUT MICROBIOTA. DRIED AND MILLED BREAD, COMPOSED OF ALMOND FLOUR, PSYLLIUM HUSKS, AND FLAX SEEDS AS ITS THREE MAIN INGREDIENTS, WAS FIRST SUBJECTED TO AN   PROTOCOL DESIGNED TO MIMIC HUMAN ORO-GASTRO-INTESTINAL DIGESTION. THE BREAD DIGEST WAS THEN SUPPLIED TO COMPLEX HUMAN GUT MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, REPLACING THE TYPICAL WESTERN DIET-BASED MEDIUM (WM) OF THE GHS SYSTEM. SWITCHING THE MEDIUM FROM WM TO BREAD DIGEST RESULTED IN STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ALTERATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, ENCODED FUNCTIONS, PRODUCED SHORT-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS, AND AVAILABLE ANTIOXIDANTS. THE ABUNDANCES OF DIETARY FIBER DEGRADERS  ,  , AND   INCREASED; LEVELS OF  ,  , AND   DECREASED. THESE COMMUNITY ALTERATIONS RESEMBLED THE PREVIOUSLY REVEALED DIFFERENCES IN THE DISTAL GUT MICROBIOTA OF HEALTHY HUMAN SUBJECTS CONSUMING TYPICAL MEDITERRANEAN VS. WESTERN-PATTERN DIETS. THEREFORE, THE CONSUMPTION OF BREAD HIGH IN DIETARY FIBER AND UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS MIGHT RECAPITULATE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET ON THE GUT MICROBIOTA.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3390/foods13111615 Year: 2024</h1><p>WHITE PEPPER, USED BOTH AS A SEASONING IN PEOPLE'S DAILY DIETS AND AS A MEDICINAL HERB, IS TYPICALLY PRODUCED BY REMOVING THE PERICARP OF GREEN PEPPER THROUGH THE RETTING PROCESS. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISM OF THE RETTING PROCESS FOR PEELING REMAINS UNCLEAR. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN PHYSICOCHEMICAL FACTORS, MICROBIAL COMMUNITY SUCCESSION EFFECTS, AND METABOLITES OF THE PEPPER PERICARP DURING THE PEPPER PEELING PROCESS. THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT PRE-TREATMENT INVOLVING PHYSICAL FRICTION BEFORE THE RETTING PROCESS EFFECTIVELY REDUCED THE PRODUCTION TIME OF WHITE PEPPER. DURING THE RETTING PROCESS, THE PECTINASE ACTIVITY INCREASED, LEADING TO A DECREASE IN THE PECTIN CONTENT IN THE PEPPER PERICARP. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION OBSERVED BETWEEN THE CHANGES IN PH, PECTIN CONTENT, AND PEELING RATE AND THE SHANNON DIVERSITY INDEX OF BACTERIA AND FUNGI.  ,  , AND   WERE THE DOMINANT MICROBIAL GENERA DURING THE RETTING. THE FUNCTIONAL PREDICTIONS SUGGESTED THAT THE MONOSACCHARIDES DEGRADED FROM THE PEPPER PERICARP COULD HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY MICROBES THROUGH SUGAR METABOLISM PATHWAYS. METABOLOMIC ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE METABOLIC PATHWAYS OF CARBOHYDRATES AND AMINO ACIDS WERE THE MAIN PATHWAYS ALTERED DURING THE PEPPER PEELING PROCESS. THE VERIFICATION EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DEGRADATION OF PECTIN INTO GALACTURONIC ACID BY POLYGALACTURONASE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE KEY ENZYME IN SHORTENING THE PEPPER PEELING TIME. THE STRUCTURE OF THE PEPPER PERICARP COLLAPSED AFTER LOSING THE SUPPORT OF PECTIN, AS REVEALED BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE PEPPER PERICARP WAS DRIVEN BY KEY MICROBIOTA. THE SUCCESSION OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES WAS INFLUENCED BY THE METABOLITES OF THE PEPPER PERICARP DURING RETTING. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE RETTING PROCESS AND SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT REFERENCE FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION OF WHITE PEPPER.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.132877 Year: 2023</h1><p>IN THIS STUDY, 16S RDNA HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING, FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE MECHANISMS DRIVING THE SEQUENCE OF DEGRADATION OF GUMMY SUBSTANCES BY THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AND HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES DURING THE FLAX DEW DEGUMMING PROCESS. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE INOCULATION OF COMBINED BACTERIA INDUCED QUORUM SENSING, MODULATED HYDROLYTIC ENZYME PRODUCTION, AND RESHAPED THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. LIGNIN-DEGRADED GENERA (PSEUDOMONAS AND SPHINGOBACTERIUM) WERE ENRICHED, AND THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF PECTIN- AND CELLULOSE-DEGRADED GENERA (CHRYSEOBACTERIUM) DECREASED IN THE EARLY DEGUMMING STAGES. HEMICELLULOSE-DEGRADED GENERA (BREVUNDIMONAS) INCREASED OVER THE DEGUMMING TIME. MOREOVER, THE ABUNDANCE OF LIGNIN HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES IMPROVED IN THE EARLY STAGES, WHILE THE ABUNDANCE OF PECTIN HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES INCREASED AT THE END OF DEGUMMING. VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNCTIONAL BACTERIA TAXA CHANGED THE SEQUENCE OF SUBSTANCE DEGRADATION. ELECTRON SCANNING MICROSCOPY AND DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE DEGUMMING, FACILITATED BY THE INOCULATION OF COMBINED BACTERIA, WAS NEARLY COMPLETED BY 21 D. THE FIBERS EXHIBITED SMOOTHER AND MORE INTACT PROPERTIES, ALONG WITH HIGHER THERMAL STABILITY, AS INDICATED BY A MELTING TEMPERATURE OF 71.54 °C.

HEREIN, A METAGENOMIC APPROACH WAS USED TO SCREEN CORE MICROORGANISMS ( ,  ,  , AND  ) POSSESSING LIGNOCELLULOSE-DEGRADING ABILITIES AMONG SAMPLES FROM THREE ENVIRONMENTS: PILE RETTING WHEAT STRAW (WS), WS RETURNED TO SOIL, AND FOREST SOIL. SUBSEQUENTLY, SYNTHETIC MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR FERMENTATION-ENZYME PRODUCTION. THE CRUDE ENZYME SOLUTION OBTAINED WAS USED TO PRETREAT WS AND WAS COMPARED WITH TWO COMMERCIAL ENZYMES. THE SYNTHETIC MICROBIAL COMMUNITY ENZYME-PRODUCING PRETREATMENT (SMCEP) YIELDED THE HIGHEST ENZYMATIC DIGESTION EFFICACY FOR WS, YIELDING CELLULOSE, HEMICELLULOSE, AND LIGNIN DEGRADATION RATES OF 39.85, 36.99, AND 19.21%, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, PRETREATMENT OF WS WITH AN ENZYME SOLUTION, FOLLOWED BY ANAEROBIC DIGESTION ACHIEVED SATISFACTORY RESULTS. SMCEP DISPLAYED THE HIGHEST CUMULATIVE BIOGAS PRODUCTION AT 801.16 ML/G TS, WHICH WAS 38.79% HIGHER THAN THAT OBSERVED FOR WS, 22.15% HIGHER THAN THAT OF SOLID-STATE COMMERCIAL ENZYME PRETREATMENT AND 25.41% HIGHER THAN THAT OF LIQUID COMMERCIAL ENZYME PRETREATMENT.

THE MOST WELL-CHARACTERIZED CANNABINOIDS, CANNABIDIOL (CBD) AND Δ9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (Δ9-THC), GARNERED MUCH ATTENTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) TREATMENT. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE BIOLOGICAL BENEFITS AND MECHANISM OF HEMP EXTRACT ON CIPN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, HEMP EXTRACT (JG) RICH IN CANNABINOIDS WAS EXTRACTED BY SUPERCRITICAL FLUID CARBON DIOXIDE EXTRACTION (SFCE). THE ANTINOCICEPTIVE EFFICACY WAS EVALUATED USING A PACLITAXEL-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (PIPN) RAT MODEL BASED ON BEHAVIORAL TESTS. FURTHER OMICS-BASED APPROACHES WERE APPLIED TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT JG DECREASED MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA, THERMAL HYPERALGESIA, AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN PIPN RATS SIGNIFICANTLY. TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED SEVEN KEY GENES SIGNIFICANTLY REGULATED BY JG IN PIPN MODEL RATS, MAINLY RELATED TO THE NEUROACTIVE LIGAND-RECEPTOR INTERACTION PATHWAY, PPAR SIGNALING PATHWAY, AND CAMP SIGNALING PATHWAY. IN METABOLOMIC ANALYSIS, A TOTAL OF 39 SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED METABOLITES WERE IDENTIFIED, MAINLY CORRELATED WITH PENTOSE AND GLUCURONATE INTERCONVERSIONS AND THE GLYCEROPHOSPHOLIPID METABOLISM PATHWAY. GUT MICROBIOTA ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT INCREASED COMMUNITY   AND   IN PIPN RATS CAN BE REVERSED SIGNIFICANTLY BY JG. IN CONCLUSION, HEMP EXTRACT EXHIBITED ANTINOCICEPTIVE EFFECTS ON PIPN. THE ANALGESIC MECHANISM WAS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE REGULATION OF INFLAMMATION, NEUROACTIVE LIGAND-RECEPTOR INTERACTION PATHWAY, SPHINGOLIPID METABOLISM, ETC.

THIS STUDY PROFILED THE ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES HARBOURED BY 16 HEMP CULTIVARS SOURCED FROM COMMERCIAL SUPPLIERS IN EUROPE. A 16S RDNA AMPLICON SEQUENCING APPROACH IDENTIFIED 917 AMPLICON SEQUENCE VARIANTS ACROSS SAMPLES. TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION OF SEQUENCES REVEALED 4 PHYLA AND 87 GENERA TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE DATASET. SEVERAL GENERA WERE WIDESPREAD WHILE SOME WERE SPECIFIC TO ONE OR A FEW CULTIVARS. FLAVOBACTERIUM, PSEUDOMONAS, AND PANTOEA WERE NOTABLE IN THEIR HIGH OVERALL ABUNDANCE AND PREVALENCE, BUT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS VARIABLE AND NO ONE TAXON WAS UNIVERSALLY ABUNDANT, SUGGESTING A HIGH DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION AND ALPHA DIVERSITY DIFFERED AMONG CULTIVARS, THOUGH FURTHER WORK IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF HEMP GENETIC FACTORS ON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. THE TAXONOMIC PROFILES PRESENTED HERE CAN BE USED TO INFORM FURTHER WORK INVESTIGATING THE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND POTENTIAL PLANT-GROWTH-PROMOTING TRAITS OF SEED-BORNE BACTERIA IN HEMP.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1186/s12870-024-04970-4 Year: 2024</h1><p>THE EXTRACTION OF BAST FIBRES SUCH AS JUTE FROM PLANT STEMS INVOLVES THE REMOVAL OF PECTIN, HEMICELLULOSE, AND OTHER NONCELLULOSIC MATERIALS THROUGH A COMPLEX MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. A CONSORTIUM OF PECTINOLYTIC BACTERIAL STRAINS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND COMMERCIALIZED TO REDUCE THE RETTING TIME AND ENHANCE FIBRE QUALITY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO STUDIES ON JUTE THAT DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND SEQUENTIAL MICROBIAL COLONIZATION AND PECTIN LOSS THAT OCCUR DURING MICROBE-ASSISTED WATER RETTING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE STAGES OF MICROBIAL COLONIZATION, MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS, AND SEQUENTIAL DEGRADATION OF PECTIC SUBSTANCES FROM JUTE BARK UNDER CONTROLLED AND CONVENTIONAL WATER RETTING. THE PRIMARY OCCURRENCE DURING WATER RETTING OF BAST FIBRES IS THE BACTERIALLY INDUCED SEQUENTIAL BREAKDOWN OF PECTIN SURROUNDING THE FIBRE BUNDLES. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE PECTIN CONTENT OF THE JUTE STEM SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES DURING THE RETTING PROCESS. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVING MICROBIAL STRAINS FOR IMPROVED PECTINOLYSIS WITH IMMENSE INDUSTRIAL SIGNIFICANCE, LEADING TO A SUSTAINABLE JUTE-BASED \""GREEN\"" ECONOMY.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e28050 Year: 2023</h1><p>HEMP (  L.) IS KNOWN TO TOLERATE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF SOIL CONTAMINANTS WHICH HOWEVER CAN LIMIT ITS BIOMASS YIELD. ON THE OTHER HAND, ORGANIC-BASED AMENDMENTS SUCH AS BIOCHAR CAN IMMOBILIZE SOIL CONTAMINANTS AND ASSIST HEMP GROWTH IN SOILS CONTAMINATED BY POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS (PTES), ALLOWING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECOVERY AND INCOME GENERATION, E.G. DUE TO GREEN ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM PLANT BIOMASS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS THEREFORE TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF A SOFTWOOD-DERIVED BIOCHAR TO ENHANCE HEMP GROWTH AND PROMOTE THE ASSISTED PHYTOREMEDIATION OF A PTE-CONTAMINATED SOIL (I.E., SB 2175 MG KG ; ZN 3149 MG KG ; PB 403 MG KG ; AND CD 12 MG KG ). ADDING 3% (W/W) BIOCHAR TO SOIL FAVOURED THE REDUCTION OF SOLUBLE AND EXCHANGEABLE PTES, DECREASED SOIL DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY (BY ∼2.08-FOLD), AND INCREASED ALKALINE PHOSPHOMONOESTERASE AND UREASE ACTIVITIES, BASAL RESPIRATION AND SOIL MICROBIAL CARBON (BY ∼1.18-, 1.22-, 1.22-, AND 1.66-FOLD, RESPECTIVELY). BIOCHAR INCREASED THE ABUNDANCE OF SELECTED SOIL CULTURABLE MICROORGANISMS, WHILE AMPLICON SEQUENCING ANALYSIS SHOWED A POSITIVE BIOCHAR IMPACT ON Α-DIVERSITY AND THE INDUCTION OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES ON SOIL BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. BIOCHAR DID NOT AFFECT ROOT GROWTH OF HEMP BUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS BY ∼1.67-FOLD FOR SHOOTS, AND BY ∼2-FOLD FOR BOTH SEED NUMBER AND WEIGHT. BIOCHAR INCREASED THE PTES PHYTOSTABILISATION POTENTIAL OF HEMP WITH RESPECT TO CD, PB AND ZN, AND ALSO STIMULATED HEMP PHYTOEXTRACTING CAPACITY WITH RESPECT TO SB. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BIOCHAR CAN BOOST HEMP YIELD AND ITS PHYTOREMEDIATION EFFECTIVENESS IN SOILS CONTAMINATED BY PTES PROVIDING VALUABLE BIOMASS THAT CAN GENERATE PROFIT IN ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY TERMS.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1016/j.dib.2023.109827 Year: 2023</h1><p>FLAX (  L.), ONE OF THE IMPORTANT AND VERSATILE CROPS, IS USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND FIBER. TO OBTAIN HIGH AND STABLE YIELDS OF FLAX PRODUCTS,   VARIETIES SHOULD BE CULTIVATED UNDER OPTIMAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL MICROBIOME. WE EVALUATED THE DIVERSITY OF MICROORGANISMS IN SOILS UNDER CONDITIONS UNFAVORABLE FOR FLAX CULTIVATION (SUBOPTIMAL ACIDITY OR HERBICIDE TREATMENT) OR INFECTED WITH CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF HARMFUL FLAX DISEASES ( , OR   F. SP.  ). FOR THIS PURPOSE, TWENTY-TWO SOD-PODZOLIC SOIL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM FLAX FIELDS AND THEIR METAGENOMES WERE ANALYZED USING THE REGIONS OF 16S RIBOSOMAL RNA GENE (16S RDNA) AND INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACERS (ITS) OF THE RIBOSOMAL RNA GENES, WHICH ARE USED IN PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES OF BACTERIA AND FUNGI. AMPLICONS WERE SEQUENCED ON THE ILLUMINA MISEQ PLATFORM (READS OF 300 + 300 BP). ON AVERAGE, WE OBTAINED 8,400 READS FOR ITS AND 43,300 READS FOR 16S RDNA PER SAMPLE. FOR IDENTIFICATION OF MICROORGANISMS IN THE SOIL SAMPLES, THE ILLUMINA READS WERE PROCESSED USING DADA2. THE RAW DATA ARE DEPOSITED IN THE SEQUENCE READ ARCHIVE UNDER THE BIOPROJECT ACCESSION NUMBER PRJNA956957. TABLES LISTING THE MICROORGANISMS IDENTIFIED IN THE SOIL SAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS ARTICLE. THE OBTAINED DATASET CAN BE USED TO ANALYZE THE FUNGAL AND BACTERIAL COMPOSITION OF FLAX FIELD SOILS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING SUBOPTIMAL SOIL ACIDITY AND INFECTION WITH FUNGAL PATHOGENS. IN ADDITION, IT CAN HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF HERBICIDE TREATMENT ON THE MICROBIAL DIVERSITY OF FLAX FIELDS. ANOTHER USEFUL APPLICATION OF OUR DATA IS THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE SUITABILITY OF THE SOIL MICROBIOME FOR FLAX CULTIVATION.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3389/fmicb.2023.1278189 Year: 2023</h1><p>MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL USES OF  , COMMONLY KNOWN AS CANNABIS OR HEMP, HAS INCREASED FOLLOWING ITS LEGALIZATION IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE WORLD. CANNABIS AND HEMP PLANTS INTERACT WITH A COMMUNITY OF MICROBES (I.E., THE PHYTOBIOME), WHICH CAN INFLUENCE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE HOST PLANT. THE FUNGAL COMPOSITION OF THE   PHYTOBIOME (I.E., MYCOBIOME) CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF OVER 100 SPECIES OF FUNGI, WHICH INCLUDES PHYTOPATHOGENS, EPIPHYTES, AND ENDOPHYTES, THIS MYCOBIOME HAS OFTEN BEEN UNDERSTUDIED IN RESEARCH AIMED AT EVALUATING THE SAFETY OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR HUMANS. MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED INSTEAD ON SUBSTANCE USE AND MEDICINAL USES OF THE PLANT. BECAUSE SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF THE MYCOBIOME ARE REPORTED TO PRODUCE TOXIC SECONDARY METABOLITES (I.E., MYCOTOXINS) THAT CAN POTENTIALLY AFFECT THE HEALTH OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS AND INITIATE OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS, THERE IS A NEED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS THAT THESE CONTAMINANTS COULD POSE FOR CONSUMERS. THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE MYCOBIOME OF CANNABIS AND HEMP FLOWERS WITH A FOCUS ON PLANT-INFECTING AND TOXIGENIC FUNGI THAT ARE MOST COMMONLY FOUND AND ARE OF POTENTIAL CONCERN (E.G.,   AND   SPP.). WE REVIEW CURRENT REGULATIONS FOR MOLDS AND MYCOTOXINS WORLDWIDE AND REVIEW ASSESSMENT METHODS INCLUDING CULTURE-BASED ASSAYS, LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY, IMMUNO-BASED TECHNOLOGIES, AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THESE CONTAMINANTS. WE ALSO DISCUSS APPROACHES TO REDUCE FUNGAL CONTAMINANTS ON CANNABIS AND HEMP AND IDENTIFY FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS FOR CONTAMINANT DETECTION, DATA DISSEMINATION, AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES. THESE APPROACHES ARE DESIGNED TO YIELD SAFER PRODUCTS FOR ALL CONSUMERS.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1007/s00253-023-12582-5 Year: 2022</h1><p>THE INDUSTRIAL HEMP PLANT CANNABIS SATIVA IS A SOURCE OF VEGETABLE FIBER FOR BOTH TEXTILES AND BIOCOMPOSITE APPLICATIONS. AFTER HARVESTING, THE PLANT STEMS ARE LAID OUT ON THE GROUND AND COLONIZED BY MICROORGANISMS (BACTERIA AND FUNGI) NATURALLY PRESENT IN THE SOIL AND ON THE STEMS. BY PRODUCING HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES THAT DEGRADE THE PLANT WALL POLYMERS, THE NATURAL CEMENT THAT BINDS THE FIBER BUNDLES TOGETHER IS REMOVED, THUS FACILITATING THEIR DISSOCIATION (RETTING PROCESS) WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PRODUCING HIGH-PERFORMANT FIBERS. TO INVESTIGATE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF RETTING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES (DENSITY LEVELS, DIVERSITY, AND STRUCTURE), A RELIABLE PROTOCOL FOR EXTRACTING GENOMIC DNA FROM STEMS IS MANDATORY. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF NUCLEIC ACID EXTRACTION, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FINAL RESULT. THREE PROTOCOLS WERE SELECTED AND TESTED: A COMMERCIAL KIT (FASTDNA™ SPIN KIT FOR SOIL), THE GNS-GII PROCEDURE, AND A CUSTOM PROCEDURE FROM THE GENOSOL PLATFORM. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT ON SOIL AND TWO DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF HEMP STEM. THE EFFICIENCY OF EACH METHOD WAS MEASURED BY EVALUATING BOTH THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE EXTRACTED DNA AND THE ABUNDANCE AND TAXONOMY OF BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL POPULATIONS. THE GENOSOL PROTOCOL PROVIDES INTERESTING YIELDS IN TERMS OF QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF GENOMIC DNA COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO PROTOCOLS. HOWEVER, NO MAJOR DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN MICROBIAL DIVERSITY BETWEEN THE TWO EXTRACTION PROCEDURES (FASTDNA™ SPIN KIT AND GENOSOL PROTOCOL). BASED ON THESE RESULTS, THE FASTDNA™ SPIN KIT OR THE GENOSOL PROCEDURE SEEMS TO BE SUITABLE FOR STUDYING BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COMMUNITIES OF THE RETTING PROCESS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING BIASES ASSOCIATED WITH DNA RECOVERY FROM HEMP STEMS. KEY POINTS: • METAGENOMIC DNA WAS SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED FROM HEMP STEM SAMPLES USING THREE DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS. • FURTHER EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED IN TERMS OF DNA YIELD AND PURITY, ABUNDANCE LEVEL, AND MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. • THIS WORK EXHIBITED THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE OF DNA RECOVERY BIAS EVALUATION.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1038/s41598-023-35241-1 Year: 2022</h1><p>A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING HEMP BY-PRODUCTS AS LIVESTOCK FEEDSTUFFS; HOWEVER, THEIR IMPACT ON LIVESTOCK MICROBIOMES REMAINS UNEXPLORED. HERE, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF FEEDING HEMPSEED CAKE ON THE GASTROINTESTINAL, RESPIRATORY, AND REPRODUCTIVE MICROBIOTA IN BEEF HEIFERS. ANGUS-CROSSBRED HEIFERS (19-MONTHS OLD, INITIAL BODY WEIGHT = 494 ± 10 KG [SE]) WERE FED A CORN-BASED FINISHING DIET CONTAINING 20% HEMPSEED CAKE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR 20% CORN DRIED DISTILLERS' GRAINS WITH SOLUBLES (DM BASIS; CONTROL; N = 16/GROUP) FOR 111 DAYS UNTIL SLAUGHTER. RUMINAL FLUID AND DEEP NASOPHARYNGEAL SWABS (DAYS 0, 7, 42, 70 AND 98), AND VAGINAL AND UTERINE SWABS (AT SLAUGHTER) WERE COLLECTED, AND THE MICROBIOTA ASSESSED USING 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCING. DIET AFFECTED THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE RUMINAL (D 7-98; 0.06 ≤ R  ≤ 0.12; P < 0.05), NASOPHARYNGEAL (D 98; R  = 0.18; P < 0.001), AND VAGINAL (R  = 0.06; P < 0.01) MICROBIOTA. HEIFERS FED HEMPSEED CAKE HAD INCREASED MICROBIAL DIVERSITY IN THE RUMEN, REDUCED MICROBIAL RICHNESS IN THE VAGINA, AND GREATER MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND RICHNESS IN THE UTERUS. IN ADDITION TO THE DISTINCT MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IN THE RUMEN, NASOPHARYNX, VAGINA AND UTERUS, WE IDENTIFIED 28 CORE TAXA THAT WERE SHARED (≥ 60% OF ALL SAMPLES) ACROSS THESE SAMPLING LOCATIONS. FEEDING HEMPSEED CAKE APPEARED TO ALTER THE BOVINE GUT, RESPIRATORY AND REPRODUCTIVE MICROBIOTA. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FUTURE RESEARCH AIMING TO EVALUATE THE USE OF HEMP BY-PRODUCTS IN LIVESTOCK DIET SHOULD CONSIDER THEIR IMPACT ON ANIMAL MICROBIOME AND MICROBIOME MEDIATED ANIMAL HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY.

THE EFFICIENCY OF WATER RETTING OF JUTE DEPENDS ON PLANT POLYSACCHARIDE FERMENTING PECTINOLYTIC MICROORGANISMS. UNDERSTANDING THE PHASE DIFFERENCE IN RETTING MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IS CRUCIAL TO PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE ON THE FUNCTIONS OF EACH MEMBER OF MICROBIOTA FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF RETTING AND FIBER QUALITY. THE RETTING MICROBIOTA PROFILING OF JUTE WAS COMMONLY PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY USING ONLY ONE RETTING PHASE WITH CULTURE-DEPENDENT METHODS WHICH HAS LIMITED COVERAGE AND ACCURACY. HERE, FOR THE FIRST WE HAVE ANALYZED JUTE RETTING WATER THROUGH WGS METAGENOME APPROACH IN THREE PHASES (PRE-RETTING, AEROBIC RETTING, AND ANAEROBIC RETTING PHASES) AND CHARACTERIZED THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES BOTH CULTURABLE AND NON-CULTURABLE ALONG WITH THEIR DYNAMICS WITH THE FLUCTUATION OF OXYGEN AVAILABILITY. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED A TOTAL OF 25.99 × 10  UNKNOWN PROTEINS (13.75%), 16.18 × 10  ANNOTATED PROTEINS (86.08%), AND 32.68 × 10  RIBOSOMAL RNA (0.17%) IN THE PRE-RETTING PHASE, 15.12 × 10  UNKNOWN PROTEINS (8.53%), 16.18 × 10  ANNOTATED PROTEINS (91.25%), AND 38.62 × 10  RIBOSOMAL RNA (0.22%) IN THE AEROBIC RETTING PHASE, AND 22.68 × 102 RIBOSOMAL RNA AND 80.14 × 10  (99.72%) ANNOTATED PROTEIN IN THE ANAEROBIC RETTING PHASE. TAXONOMICALLY, WE IDENTIFIED 53 DIFFERENT PHYLOTYPES IN THE RETTING ENVIRONMENT, WITH PROTEOBACTERIA BEING THE DOMINANT TAXA COMPRISING OVER 60% OF THE POPULATION. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED 915 GENERA FROM ARCHAEA, VIRUSES, BACTERIA, AND EUKARYOTA IN THE RETTING HABITAT, WITH ANAEROBIC OR FACULTATIVE ANAEROBIC PECTINOLYTIC MICROFLORA BEING ENRICHED IN THE ANOXIC, NUTRIENT-RICH RETTING NICHE, SUCH AS AEROMONAS (7%), BACTEROIDES (3%), CLOSTRIDIUM (6%), DESULFOVIBRIO (4%), ACINETOBACTER (4%), ENTEROBACTER (1%), PREVOTELLA (2%), ACIDOVORAX (3%), BACILLUS (1%), BURKHOLDERIA (1%), DECHLOROMONAS (2%), CAULOBACTER (1%) AND PSEUDOMONAS (7%). WE OBSERVED AN INCREASE IN THE EXPRESSION OF 30 DIFFERENT KO FUNCTIONAL LEVEL 3 PATHWAYS IN THE FINAL RETTING STAGE COMPARED TO THE MIDDLE AND PRE-RETTING STAGES. THE MAIN FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES AMONG THE RETTING PHASES WERE FOUND TO BE RELATED TO NUTRIENT ABSORPTION AND BACTERIAL COLONIZATION.

SATIVA CULTIVARS. FROM ONE COMMERCIAL FACILITY, INFECTED LEAVES OF THREE CANNABIS CULTIVARS (SOUR DIESEL, ORANGE KRUSH, AND LEMON SOUR) WERE PHOTOGRAPHED AND THE FUNGAL MYCELIUM WAS COLLECTED FOR IDENTIFICATION IN THE LABORATORY. FUNGAL MYCELIUM ON LEAF TISSUE WAS WHITE AND AMPHIGENOUS AND DISPLAYED UNBRANCHED HYALINE CONIDIOPHORES RANGING FROM 130 TO 275 ΜM IN HEIGHT (N = 50). CONIDIOPHORES AROSE FROM THE UPPER SURFACE OF HYPHAL MOTHER CELLS RANGING FROM 35-70 × 8-13 ΜM IN DIAMETER (N = 25) AND FORMED CATENESCENT CONIDIA. CONIDIA WERE BROAD ELLIPSOID-OVOID AND MEASURED, 24 TO 35 × 12 TO 19 ΜM (N = 50), AND HYPHAE RANGED FROM 3-8 ΜM IN DIAMETER (N = 30).

HOWEVER, THE INTEGRATED EFFECT OF ORGANIC AMENDMENTS AND HYDROLOGICAL CYCLES ON SOIL HEALTH INDICATORS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS STUDY, WE QUANTIFIED THE IMPACT OF HEMP RESIDUE (HR), HEMP BIOCHAR (HB), AND HARDWOOD BIOCHAR (HA) ON FIVE HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES, SOIL MICROBIAL PHOSPHOLIPID (PLFA) COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, PH, PERMANGANATE OXIDIZABLE CARBON (POXC) SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC), AND TOTAL NITROGEN (TN). WE COMPARED TWO SOIL TYPES, PIEDMONT AND COASTAL PLAIN SOILS OF NORTH CAROLINA, UNDER (I) A 30-D MOISTURE CYCLE MAINTAINED AT 60% WATER-FILLED PORE SPACE (WFPS) (D-W1), FOLLOWED BY (II) A 7-DAY ALTERNATE DRY-WET CYCLE FOR 42 DAYS (D-W2), OR (III) MAINTAINED AT 60% WFPS FOR 42 DAYS (D-W3) DURING AN AEROBIC LABORATORY INCUBATION. RESULTS SHOWED THAT HR AND HB SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE GEOMETRIC MEAN ENZYME ACTIVITY BY 1-2-FOLD IN THE PIEDMONT SOIL UNDER THE THREE MOISTURE CYCLES AND ABOUT 1.5-FOLD UNDER D-W IN THE COASTAL SOIL. IN THE PRESENCE OF HA, THE MEASURED SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN CONTROL UNDER THE MOISTURE CYCLES IN BOTH SOIL TYPES. THE SHIFT IN MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WAS DISTINCT IN THE COASTAL SOIL BUT NOT IN THE PIEDMONT SOIL. UNDER D-W2, HR AND HB SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED POXC (600-700 MG POXC KG-1 SOIL) IN THE COASTAL SOIL BUT NOT IN THE PIEDMONT SOIL WHILE HA INCREASED NITRATE (8 MG KG-1) RETENTION IN THE COASTAL SOIL. THE DIFFERENCES IN AMENDMENT EFFECT ON PH SOC, TN, POXC, AND NITRATE WERE LESS DISTINCT IN THE FINE-TEXTURED PIEDMONT SOIL THAN THE COARSE-TEXTURED COASTAL SOIL. OVERALL, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT, UNLIKE HA, HR AND HB WILL HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SOIL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY, THEREFORE POTENTIALLY IMPROVING SOIL'S RESILIENCE TO CHANGING CLIMATE.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1016/j.funbio.2021.11.001 Year: 2021</h1><p>LIVING ORGANISMS CAN INDUCE DETERIORATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE. CONSERVATION STRATEGIES AIMED AT AVOIDING DAMAGE AND AIDING RESTORATION, REQUIRE A COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF STRUCTURE, CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, AND IDENTITY OF MICROORGANISMS THAT COLONIZE ARTWORKS. THE NATIONAL THEATRE OF COSTA RICA (NTCR), A BUILDING WITH HISTORIC ARCHITECTURE, HOUSES SEVERAL OIL PAINTINGS FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, SOME WITH VISIBLE SIGNS OF BIODETERIORATION. ONE OF THEM IS A LARGE FORMAT PAINTING ON CANVAS CALLED LA DANZA (SIZE 9.83 × 5.13 M) FROM 1896 BY ITALIAN ARTIST VESPASIANO BIGNAMI, LOCATED ON THE CEILING OF THE THEATRE'S FOYER. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE UNDERTOOK A PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDY OF LA DANZA TO IDENTIFY THE FUNGAL SPECIES THAT INHABIT THE ARTWORK AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE OBSERVED. SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (SEM) IMAGES AND ATTENUATED TOTAL REFLECTANCE - FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (ATR-FTIR) SPECTROSCOPIC DATA INDICATED THAT THE CANVAS MATERIAL IS MADE OF HEMP, THE BINDER CONTAINS LINSEED OIL AND LEAD WHITE, AND A MATERIAL IN THE INNER FACE OF THE CANVAS IS MAINLY COMPOSED OF BEESWAX. FUNGI WERE ISOLATED ONTO POTATO DEXTROSE AGAR (PDA) AND CARBOXYMETHYL CELLULOSE (CMC) AGAR, AND THEN IDENTIFIED WITH MOLECULAR (BTUB, NRDNA ITS, AND TEF1 REGIONS) AND MORPHOLOGICAL METHODS. FOUR ISOLATES BELONGING TO THE GENERA MYXOSPORA, PESTALOTIOPSIS, USTILAGO, AND AFF. PENICILLIUM, WERE OBTAINED. QUALITATIVE TESTS SHOWED CELLULOLYTIC ACTIVITY IN ALL ISOLATED SPECIMENS, CONFIRMING THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN BIODETERIORATION OF THE CANVAS. PHYLOGENETIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL DATA REVEALED A NEW SPECIES OF MYXOSPORA WE NAME HERE AS MYXOSPORA THEATRO SP. NOV., IN REFERENCE TO NTCR. THE FINDINGS BROADEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF FUNGI CAPABLE OF INHABITING AND DAMAGING CULTURAL HERITAGE.

AMENDMENTS WITH HALOTOLERANT PHOSPHATE-SOLUBILIZING BACTERIA (PSB) AND ROCK PHOSPHATE (RP) MAY IMPROVE PROPERTIES OF SALINE SOIL. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF RP EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH PSB (  STRAIN TPM23) ON PEANUT GROWTH AND SOIL QUALITY IN A SALINE SOIL. WITH THE COMBINED APPLICATION OF RP AND PSB, PLANT LENGTH AND BIOMASS (ROOTS AND SHOOTS) AND UPTAKE OF PHOSPHORUS (P), NITROGEN (N), AND POTASSIUM (K) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. SOIL NA  AND CL  CONTENTS DECREASED IN THE PR ALONE OR PR COMBINED WITH PSB TREATMENT GROUPS. THERE WERE STRONGLY SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS OF RP AND PSB ON SOIL QUALITY, INCLUDING A DECREASE IN PH. THE SOIL AVAILABLE N, P, AND K CONTENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PSB TREATMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE ALKALINE PHOSPHOMONOESTERASES, UREASE, AND DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITIES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THE UNTREATED GROUP; HIGHEST ALKALINE PHOSPHOMONOESTERASES ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE RP AND PSB TREATMENT GROUPS. THE COMPOSITION OF RHIZOSPHERE SOIL BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES WAS DETERMINED USING 454-PYROSEQUENCING OF THE 16S RRNA GENE. IN THE PR ALONE OR PR COMBINED WITH PSB TREATMENT GROUPS, THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOIL BACTERIAL COMMUNITY IMPROVED WITH INCREASING RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY. WITH PSB INOCULATION, THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF  ,  , AND   INCREASED. THE THREE PHYLA WERE ALSO POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOIL AVAILABLE N AND ROOT DRY WEIGHT. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED MICROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE COMBINED USE OF RP AND PSB IMPROVED SALINE SOIL AND PROMOTED PLANT GROWTH. OVERALL, THE STUDY INDICATES THE COMBINED USE OF RP AND PSB CAN BE AN ECONOMICAL AND SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY TO INCREASE PLANT GROWTH IN P-DEFICIENT AND SALT-AFFECTED SOILS.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3389/fmicb.2021.741597 Year: 2021</h1><p>HEMP (  L.)

HEMP PLANTS INTERACT WITH A MYRIAD OF MICROBIOTA INHABITING THE PHYLLOSPHERE, ENDOSPHERE, RHIZOPLANE, AND RHIZOSPHERE. THESE MICROBES OFFER MANY ECOLOGICAL SERVICES, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF BELOW GROUND BIOTOPES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN NUTRIENT CYCLING, UPTAKE, AND ALLEVIATING BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS.

TO DISCOVER CORE MICROBIOTA ASSOCIATED WITH FIELD GROWN HEMP, WE CULTIVATED SINGLE   CULTIVAR, \""TJ'S CBD,\"" IN SIX DIFFERENT FIELDS IN NEW YORK AND SAMPLED HEMP ROOTS AND THEIR RHIZOSPHERIC SOIL. WE USED ILLUMINA MISEQ AMPLICON SEQUENCING TARGETING 16S RIBOSOMAL DNA OF BACTERIA AND ITS OF FUNGI TO STUDY MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF HEMP ROOTS AND RHIZOSPHERES. WE FOUND THAT PLANCTOBACTERIA AND ASCOMYCOTA DOMINATED THE TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION OF HEMP ASSOCIATED MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. WE IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL CORE MICROBIOTA IN EACH COMMUNITY (BACTERIA: EIGHT BACTERIAL AMPLICON SEQUENCE VARIANT - ASV, IDENTIFIED AS   AND UNCLASSIFIED PLANCTOBACTERIA; FUNGI: THREE ASVS IDENTIFIED AS  ,  , AND  ). WE FOUND 14 ASVS AS HUB TAXA [EIGHT BACTERIAL ASVS (BASV) IN THE ROOT, AND FOUR BACTERIAL AND TWO FUNGAL ASVS IN THE RHIZOSPHERE SOIL], AND 10 BASV CONNECTED THE ROOT AND RHIZOSPHERE SOIL MICROBIOTA TO FORM AN EXTENDED MICROBIAL COMMUNICATION IN HEMP. THE ONLY HUB TAXA DETECTED IN BOTH THE ROOT AND RHIZOSPHERE SOIL MICROBIOTA WAS ASV37 ( ), A BACTERIAL TAXON. THE CORE MICROBIOTA AND NETWORK HUB TAXA CAN BE STUDIED FURTHER FOR BIOCONTROL ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE FORMULATION OF HEMP BIOINOCULANTS.

THESE MUCILAGES ARE NATURAL AND COMPATIBLE BLENDS OF DIFFERENT POLYSACCHARIDES THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED MEDICAL BENEFITS. ALL THREE SEED MUCILAGE FILMS EXHIBITED HIGH MOISTURE RETENTION REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF PROBIOTICS, WHICH IS NEEDED TO HELP PRESERVE THE MOISTURE/FRESHNESS OF FOOD. FILMS FROM FLAX AND QUINCE MUCILAGE WERE FOUND TO BE MORE THERMALLY STABLE AND MECHANICALLY ROBUST WITH HIGHER ELASTIC MODULI AND ELONGATION AT BREAK THAN BASIL MUCILAGE FILMS. THESE FILMS EFFECTIVELY PROTECTED FRUITS AGAINST UV LIGHT, MAINTAINING THE PROBIOTICS VIABILITY AND INACTIVATION RATE DURING STORAGE. COATED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES RETAINED THEIR FRESHNESS LONGER THAN UNCOATED PRODUCE, WHILE QUINCE-BASED PROBIOTIC FILMS SHOWED THE BEST MECHANICAL, PHYSICAL, MORPHOLOGICAL AND BACTERIAL VIABILITY.

THE LARVAL HYBRIDS THEN CATASTROPHICALLY SUCCUMB TO BACTERIUM-ASSISTED LETHALITY AND REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION BETWEEN THE SPECIES. TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING PHYLOSYMBIOSIS AND BACTERIUM-ASSISTED LETHALITY IN HYBRIDS ARE (I) DO THE   BACTERIAL GENOMES DIFFER FROM OTHER ANIMAL ISOLATES AND (II) ARE THE HYBRID BACTERIAL GENOMES THE SAME AS THOSE IN THE PARENTAL SPECIES?

SINCE THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT MICROBES PLAY A ROLE IN THE INTERACTION ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE INTERACTION, WE STUDIED THE MICROBIAL DIVERSITY HARBORED BY THE PARASITIC SEEDS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR HOST AND GENETIC GROUP. TWENTY-SIX SEED LOTS FROM SEVEN CROPPING PLOTS OF THREE DIFFERENT HOSTS-OILSEED RAPE, TOBACCO, AND HEMP-IN THE WEST OF FRANCE WERE CHARACTERIZED FOR THEIR BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COMMUNITIES USING 16S RRNA GENE AND ITS (INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER) SEQUENCES, RESPECTIVELY. FIRST SEEDS WERE CHARACTERIZED GENETICALLY USING TWENTY MICROSATELLITE MARKERS AND PHENOTYPED FOR THEIR SENSIBILITY TO VARIOUS GERMINATION STIMULANTS INCLUDING STRIGOLACTONES AND ISOTHIOCYANATES. THIS LED TO THE DISTINCTION OF THREE   GROUPS THAT CORRESPONDED TO THEIR HOST OF ORIGIN. THE OBSERVED SEED DIVERSITY WAS CORRELATED TO THE HOST SPECIALIZATION AND GERMINATION STIMULANT SENSITIVITY WITHIN   SPECIES. MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES WERE BOTH CLUSTERED BY HOST AND PLOT OF ORIGIN.

THIRTY-TWO HALF-BRED EWES WERE INVOLVED IN THE STUDY, IN WHICH HALF (CONTROL GROUP) RECEIVED A STANDARD DIET, AND THE OTHER HALF (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) TOOK A DIET ENRICHED WITH 5% HEMP SEEDS (ON A DM BASIS) FOR 35 D. THE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LACTOSE IN MILK, BUT NO VARIATIONS IN TOTAL FAT, PROTEINS, CASEINS, AND UREA WERE OBSERVED. LIKEWISE, NO CHANGES IN TOTAL FAT, PROTEINS, OR ASH WERE DETECTED IN THE DERIVED CHEESES. THE METAGENOMIC APPROACH WAS USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE MICROBIOTA OF RAW MILK AND CHEESE. THE PHYLA PROTEOBACTERIA AND FIRMICUTES WERE IN EQUALLY HIGH ABUNDANCE IN BOTH CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL RAW MILK SAMPLES, WHEREAS BACTEROIDETES WAS LESS ABUNDANT.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, A MOLECULAR APPROACH, BACTERIAL TAG-ENCODED FLX AMPLICON PYROSEQUENCING (BTEFAP) WAS APPLIED TO ACCOMPLISH DIVERSITY ANALYSES OF RUMEN BACTERIAL POPULATIONS. THIRTY-SIX KIKO-CROSS GROWING MEAT GOATS (BODY WEIGHT (BW) = 27.7 ±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

OILSEED MEAL (SM) FROM THE DEDICATED BIOENERGY CROP   WERE IMPLICATED TO CONTAIN COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES ON SOME SOIL PATHOGENS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON NON-TARGETED SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY ON FUNGI. SM FROM   CONTAINS MODERATE LEVEL OF GLUCOSINOLATES (GLS) AND WAS UNDER STUDIED. TO INVESTIGATE SOIL FUNGAL COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO JATROPHA AND CAMELINA SMS, WE CONDUCTED A LAB BASED MICROCOSM STUDY, AMENDING SOIL WITH 1% SMS OF JATROPHA, CAMELINA, FLAX, AND BIOMASS OF WHEAT STRAW. FUNGAL COMMUNITY ABUNDANCE AND STRUCTURE WERE ANALYZED BASED ON THE ITS REGION USING QPCR AND TAG-PYROSEQUENCING. MICROBIAL FUNCTIONAL CHANGES WERE EXAMINED BY COMMUNITY LEVEL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROFILE (CLPP) USING BIOLOG ASSAY. BOTH SMS FROM JATROPHA AND CAMELINA SHOWED BIOFUMIGANT PROPERTIES AND INHIBITED FUNGAL PROLIFERATION. JATROPHA SM SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED SOIL FUNGAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURES WITH LOWER FUNGAL BIODIVERSITY AND HIGHER   COMPOSITION. CAMELINA SM AMENDED SOIL PROMOTED   PROLIFERATION. CLPP INDICATED SEQUENTIAL HIERARCHY FOR C METABOLISM IN THE OILSEED-AMENDED MICROCOSMS WAS GENERALLY COMPLEX C > PHOSPHATE-ASSOCIATED C > CARBOXYLIC ACIDS > CARBOHYDRATES > AMINES > AMINO ACIDS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CLPP WAS DETECTED DUE TO THE TYPE OF SM TREATMENT. OUR DATA INDICATE THAT BOTH SMS OF JATROPHA AND CAMELINA HAVE BIOFUMIGANT PROPERTIES AND CAN DIFFERENTIALLY IMPACT SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, AND THE CHANGES WERE RELATIVELY PERSISTENT OVER TIME. MICROBIAL FUNCTIONAL PATTERNS ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE NOT IMPACTED BY SM TYPE. OUR STUDY REVEALED BIOFUMIGANT AND NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCE OF SMS FROM DEDICATED BIOFUEL PLANTS ON SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP PROPERLY USING JATROPHA AND CAMELINA SMS FOR PATHOGEN CONTROL WHILE MINIMIZING THEIR NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON NON-TARGET MICROORGANISMS. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES IN THE FIELD ARE DEMANDED TO INVESTIGATE THEIR INFLUENCES IN REAL PRACTICE.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1007/s11356-018-3346-7 Year: 2018</h1><p>SILVER AND TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES (AGNPS AND TIO NPS) ARE HIGHLY USEFUL, BUT THEY ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT REASON FOR CONCERN AS THEY EXERT TOXICITY. THE GOAL OF RESEARCH WAS TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF THREE KINDS OF NPS IN CONCENTRATIONS OF 100 MG L  ON EARLY GROWTH PLANTS (WHEAT, FLAX) AND BACTERIAL COMMUNITY IN RHIZOPLANE. TITANIUM (IV) OXIDE ANATASE (TIO NPS1) AND TITANIUM (IV) OXIDE NANOPOWDER (TIO NPS2) ARE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. A SUSPENSION OF AGNPS WAS PREPARED VIA A PROCEDURE OF REDUCTION WITH TANNIC ACID. THE RESPONSE OF MONOCOT AND DICOT GROWTH FORM PLANTS TO THE TESTED NPS WAS DIFFERENT. GERMINATION AND SEEDLING GROWTH OF WHEAT TREATED WITH TIO NPS1 WAS BETTER. THE RESPONSE OF FLAX TO NPS WAS NOTED AS AN INCREASE OF CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT. THE BACTERIAL COMMUNITY IN WHEAT RHIZOPLANE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED, BUT THERE WAS A DECLINING TREND. IN TURN, A DIFFERENCE IN THE SURFACE CHARGE OF NPS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON THE TOTAL BACTERIAL COMMUNITY IN DICOT RHIZOPLANE. POSITIVELY CHARGED TIO NPS2 SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE QUANTITY OF TOTAL BACTERIA IN CONTRAST TO NEGATIVELY CHARGED AGNPS AND TIO NPS1 WHICH INCREASED IT. A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS DID NOT CONFIRM THE INFLUENCE OF THE SURFACE CHARGE OF NPS ON AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF PSEUDOMONAS AND BACILLUS BACTERIA, BUT DID SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO TOXICITY OF THE TESTED NPS TO THE PLANT GROWTH-PROMOTING BACTERIA COMMUNITY.

BIOASSAYS BASED ON FUSARIUM WILT OF FLAX CONFIRMED THAT DISEASE INCIDENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE SUPPRESSIVE SOIL THAN IN THE CONDUCIVE SOIL. FURTHERMORE, WE SUCCEEDED IN PARTLY TRANSFERRING FUSARIUM WILT-SUPPRESSIVENESS TO THE CONDUCIVE SOIL BY MIXING 10% (W/W) OF THE SUPPRESSIVE SOIL INTO THE CONDUCIVE SOIL. FUNGAL DIVERSITY DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE SUPPRESSIVE AND CONDUCIVE SOILS.

ORGANIC DUST DERIVED IN PART FROM NATURALLY OCCURRING MICROORGANISMS IS KNOWN TO CAUSE BYSSINOSIS IN THE HEMP INDUSTRY. IN THIS PILOT STUDY, BACTERIA AND FUNGI ENCOUNTERED BY WORKERS AT AN OUTDOOR CANNABIS FARM THAT UTILIZED ORGANIC PRACTICES WERE ELUCIDATED BY 16 S RIBOSOMAL RNA (RRNA) AND INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER (ITS) REGION SEQUENCING, RESPECTIVELY. AREA (N = 14) AND PERSONAL AIR SAMPLES (N = 12) WERE COLLECTED DURING HARVESTING AND PROCESSING ACTIVITIES. 16 S RRNA AND ITS REGIONS OF EXTRACTED BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL GENOMIC DNA WERE AMPLIFIED AND SEQUENCED USING SANGER SEQUENCING. BACTERIAL SEQUENCING RESOLVED 1,077 SEQUENCES THAT WERE CLUSTERED INTO 639 OPERATIONAL TAXONOMIC UNITS (OTUS) AND PREDOMINANTLY PLACED IN THE PHYLUM, ACTINOBACTERIA (46%). PERSONAL AIR SAMPLES REVEALED HIGHER BACTERIAL AND ACTINOBACTERIA DIVERSITY COMPARED TO OUTDOOR AREA SAMPLES COLLECTED WITHIN THE FACILITY (P < 0.05). A HIGH DEGREE OF DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN BACTERIA WAS IDENTIFIED WITHIN AND BETWEEN SAMPLES. FUNGAL SEQUENCES (N = 985) WERE IDENTIFIED AND PREDOMINANTLY CLUSTERED IN THE PHYLUM ASCOMYCOTA (53%). OF THE 216 FUNGAL OTUS ELUCIDATED, THE CANNABIS PLANT PATHOGENIC SPECIES, BOTRYTIS CINEREA, WAS THE MOST PREVALENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR 34% OF ALL FUNGAL SEQUENCES. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF B. CINEREA WAS HIGHEST IN PERSONAL AIR SAMPLES (59%) COMPARED TO AREA SAMPLES COLLECTED IN THE DRYING ROOM (19%), GREENHOUSE (18%), AND OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT (6%). THERE WAS 49% SAMPLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN FUNGI IDENTIFIED WITHIN PERSONAL AIR SAMPLES, BUT HIGHER DISSIMILARITY COEFFICIENTS WERE OBSERVED WITHIN AND BETWEEN GREENHOUSE, DRYING ROOM, AND OUTDOOR AREA AIR SAMPLES. THE RESULTS OF THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGEST THAT THE CANNABIS FARM WORKERS ARE POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO ACTINOBACTERIA AS WELL AS THE CANNABIS PLANT PATHOGEN, B.

THE USE OF SOURCES RICH IN LINOLEIC AND Α-LINOLENIC ACID FAVORS THE ACCUMULATION OF CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACIDS ISOMERS, INCREASING THE HEALTHY PROPERTIES OF MILK. RUMINAL MICROBIOTA PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN DEFINING MILK FA COMPOSITION, AND ITS PROFILE IS AFFECTED BY DIET COMPOSITION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE RESPONSES OF RUMEN FA PRODUCTION AND MICROBIAL STRUCTURE TO HEMP OR LINSEED SUPPLEMENTATION IN DIETS OF DAIRY GOATS. RUMINAL MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION WAS DETERMINED BY 16S AMPLICON SEQUENCING, WHEREAS FA COMPOSITION WAS OBTAINED BY GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE. IN ALL, 18 PLURIPAROUS ALPINE GOATS FED THE SAME PRE-TREATMENT DIET FOR 40±7 DAYS WERE, THEN, ARRANGED TO THREE DIETARY TREATMENTS CONSISTING OF CONTROL, LINSEED AND HEMP SEEDS SUPPLEMENTED DIETS. INDEPENDENTLY FROM SAMPLING TIME AND DIETS, BACTERIAL COMMUNITY OF RUMINAL FLUID WAS DOMINATED BY BACTEROIDETES (ABOUT 61.2%) AND FIRMICUTES (24.2%) WITH A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF PREVOTELLACEAE (41.0%) AND VEILLONELLACEAE (9.4%) AND A LOW PRESENCE OF RUMINOCOCCACEAE (5.0%) AND LACHNOSPIRACEAE (4.3%). LINSEED SUPPLEMENTATION AFFECTED RUMINAL BACTERIA POPULATION, WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF BIODIVERSITY; IN PARTICULAR, RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF PREVOTELLA WAS REDUCED (-12.0%), WHEREAS THAT OF SUCCINIVIBRIO AND FIBROBACTER WAS INCREASED (+50.0% AND +75.0%, RESPECTIVELY). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG THE AVERAGE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF ARCHAEAL GENERA BETWEEN EACH DIETARY GROUP. MOREOVER, THE ADDITION OF LINSEED AND HEMP SEED INDUCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FA CONCENTRATION IN THE RUMEN, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SHIFT FROM C18 : 2N-6 TO C18 : 3N-3 BIOHYDROGENATION PATHWAY. FURTHERMORE, DIMETHYLACETAL COMPOSITION WAS AFFECTED BY FAT SUPPLEMENTATION, AS CONSEQUENCE OF RUMINAL BACTERIA POPULATION MODIFICATION. FINALLY, THE ASSOCIATION STUDY BETWEEN THE RUMEN FA PROFILE AND THE BACTERIAL MICROBIOME REVEALED THAT FIBROBACTERIACEAE IS THE BACTERIAL FAMILY SHOWING THE HIGHEST AND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH FA INVOLVED IN THE BIOHYDROGENATION PATHWAY OF C18 : 3N-3.</p><h1>: DOI-10.3389/fmicb.2017.02052 Year: 2017</h1><p>FLAX DEW-RETTING IS A KEY STEP IN THE INDUSTRIAL EXTRACTION OF FIBERS FROM FLAX STEMS AND IS DEPENDENT UPON THE PRODUCTION OF A BATTERY OF HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES PRODUCED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS DURING THIS PROCESS.

TWENTY-THREE BACTERIAL AND SIX FUNGAL PHYLA WERE IDENTIFIED IN SOIL SAMPLES AND 11 BACTERIAL AND FOUR FUNGAL PHYLA IN PLANT SAMPLES. DOMINANT PHYLA WERE PROTEOBACTERIA, BACTEROIDETES, ACTINOBACTERIA, AND FIRMICUTES (BACTERIA) AND ASCOMYCOTA, BASIDIOMYCOTA, AND ZYGOMYCOTA (FUNGI) ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH FLAX DEW-RETTING EXCEPT FOR BACTEROIDETES AND BASIDIOMYCOTA THAT WERE IDENTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME. RARE PHYLA ALSO IDENTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS PROCESS INCLUDED ACIDOBACTERIA, CKC4, CHLOROBI, FIBROBACTERES, GEMMATIMONADETES, NITROSPIRAE AND TM6 (BACTERIA), AND CHYTRIDIOMYCOTA (FUNGI). NO DIFFERENCES IN MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND COLONIZATION DYNAMICS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN EARLY AND STANDARD FLAX HARVESTS. IN CONTRAST, THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE OF SWATH TURNING AFFECTS BOTH BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP AND STRUCTURE IN STRAW SAMPLES AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE UNIFORM RETTING. PREDICTION OF COMMUNITY FUNCTION USING PICRUST INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE COLLECTION OF POTENTIAL BACTERIAL ENZYMES CAPABLE OF HYDROLYZING BACKBONES AND SIDE-CHAINS OF CELL WALL POLYSACCHARIDES. ASSIGNMENT OF FUNCTIONAL GUILD (FUNCTIONAL GROUP) USING FUNGUILD SOFTWARE HIGHLIGHTED A CHANGE FROM PARASITIC TO SAPROPHYTIC TROPHIC MODES IN FUNGI DURING RETTING.

FOR FIELD RETTING A CLASSIFICATION OF THE MICROBIAL EVOLUTION (BY GENE SEQUENCING) AND ENZYME PROFILES WERE CONDUCTED. BY PHYLOGENETIC FREQUENCY MAPPING, DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNGI, MANY BELONGING TO THE ASCOMYCOTA PHYLUM WERE FOUND ON THE FIBRES DURING THE FIRST 2 WEEKS OF FIELD RETTING, AND THEREAFTER, DIFFERENT TYPES OF BACTERIA, NOTABLY PROTEOBACTERIA, ALSO PROLIFERATED ON THE FIELD RETTED FIBRES. EXTRACTS FROM FIELD RETTED FIBRES EXHIBITED HIGH GLUCANASE ACTIVITIES, WHILE EXTRACTS FROM P. RADIATA CEL 26 RETTED FIBRES SHOWED HIGH POLYGALACTURONASE AND LACCASE ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT, FUNGAL RETTING GAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLUCAN CONTENT IN THE FIBRES THAN FIELD RETTING (77 VS. 67%) AND CAUSED A HIGHER REMOVAL OF PECTIN AS INDICATED BY LOWER GALACTURONAN CONTENT OF FIBRES (1.6%) AFTER FIBRES WERE RETTED FOR 20 DAYS WITH P. RADIATA CEL 26 COMPARED TO A GALACTURONAN CONTENT OF 3.6% FOR FIELD RETTED FIBRES. EFFECTIVE FIBRE STIFFNESS INCREASED SLIGHTLY AFTER RETTING WITH P. RADIATA CEL 26 FROM 65 TO 67 GPA, WHILE IT DECREASED AFTER FIELD RETTING TO 52 GPA. EFFECTIVE FIBRE STRENGTH COULD NOT BE DETERMINED SIMILARLY DUE TO VARIATIONS IN FIBRE FRACTURE STRAIN AND FIBRE-MATRIX ADHESION.

THE COMMUNITIES EXHIBITED HIGH DIVERSITY, WITH 655 MICROBIAL GENERA BELONGING TO 34 PHYLA DETECTED (31 BACTERIAL AND 3 ARCHAEAL ONES). FOR ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF THE STUDIED FACTORS ON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, A LINEAR MODEL WAS DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING AND TO OBTAIN BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. LIMING WAS SHOWN TO MODULATE THE EFFECT OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS ON THE STRUCTURE OF MICROBIAL POPULATIONS. THE DIFFERENCES IN THE STRUCTURE AND ALPHA-DIVERSITY OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES WERE SHOWN TO DEPEND MORE ON THE CROPS AND LIMING, RATHER THAN ON THE FERTILIZERS APPLIED. INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CROP FACTOR AND LIMING EXPRESSED AS AN AMBIGUOUS EFFECT OF LIMING ON THE MICROBIOME IN THE PRESENCE OF DIFFERENT PLANTS WAS RELIABLY DEMONSTRATED.

NEVERTHELESS, THE FUNCTIONAL DISSIMILARITIES AMONG CONTRASTING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, WHICH ARE GENERATED BY THE FB AND THE HFA, HAVE RARELY BEEN SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFIED IN THE SAME EXPERIMENT, AND THEIR RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OVER TIME HAVE NEVER BEEN ASSESSED. TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, WE CONDUCTED A RECIPROCAL TRANSPLANT DECOMPOSITION EXPERIMENT UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS USING LITTER AND SOIL ORIGINATING FROM FOUR ECOSYSTEMS ALONG A LAND-USE GRADIENT (FOREST, PLANTATION, GRASSLAND, AND CROPLAND) AND ONE ADDITIONAL TREATMENT USING 13C-LABELLED FLAX LITTER ALLOWING US TO ASSESS THE PRIMING EFFECT (PE) IN EACH ECOSYSTEM. WE FOUND SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS OF LQ ON CARBON MINERALIZATION (MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THE EXPLAINED VARIANCE), WHEREAS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE SOIL TYPE WAS FAIRLY LOW (LESS THAN ONE-TENTH), SUGGESTING THAT THE CONTRASTING SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES PLAY ONLY A MINOR ROLE IN REGULATING DECOMPOSITION RATES. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS ON PE SHOWED THAT WE OVERESTIMATED LITTER-DERIVED CO2 FLUXES, LITTER-MICROBE INTERACTIONS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE UNEXPLAINED VARIANCE OBSERVED IN CARBON MINERALIZATION MODELS. THE MAGNITUDES OF FB AND HFA WERE RELATIVELY SIMILAR, BUT THE DIRECTIONS OF THESE MECHANISMS WERE SOMETIMES OPPOSITE DEPENDING ON THE LITTER AND SOIL TYPES. FB AND HFA ESTIMATES CALCULATED ON PARIETAL SUGAR MASS LOSS WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THOSE CALCULATED ON ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY, CONFIRMING THE IDEA THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LITTER QUALITY AND MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE MAY MODIFY THE TRAJECTORY OF CARBON MINERALIZATION VIA ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS.

AT THE END OF MAY 2012, SYMPTOMS OF DOWNY MILDEW WERE OBSERVED ON CAMELINA PLANTS GROWN IN THE SAVINJA VALLEY IN SLOVENIA. THE DISEASE WAS FOUND IN FOUR MONITORED FIELDS (TOTAL AREA 3 HA), AND THE INCIDENCE RANGED FROM 2 TO 38% DEPENDING ON THE VARIETY. SYMPTOMATIC PLANTS SHOWED WHITISH, ABUNDANT, AND FLUFFY MYCELIA COVERING THE STEMS, FLOWERS, SEED PODS, AND UNDERSIDES OF THE LEAVES. THE DISEASE MAINLY AFFECTED THE UPPER HALF OF THE PLANTS, AND THE STEMS WERE REDUCED AND DISTORTED. DURING DISEASE PROGRESSION, THE MYCELIUM TURNED FROM GRAY TO BLACK. MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS REVEALED HYALINE, STRAIGHT CONIDIOPHORES THAT WERE BRANCHED MONOPODIALLY (3 TO 4 TIMES) WITH 6 TO 12 RE-CURVED TIPS/BRANCH, AND MEASURED 140 TO 300 × 12 TO 20 ΜM. CONIDIA WERE HYALINE, OVAL TO BROADLY ELLIPSOIDAL, 24 TO 29 × 18 TO 24 ΜM. OOSPORES FORMED IN NECROTIC STEM AND LEAF TISSUES WERE DARK BROWN AND MEASURED 30 TO 38 ΜM IN DIAMETER. BASED ON THESE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE CAUSAL AGENT WAS IDENTIFIED AS HYALOPERONOSPORA CAMELINAE (1,3,4,5). DNA WAS EXTRACTED FROM MYCELIUM AND CONIDIA COLLECTED FROM INFECTED PLANTS IN TWO FIELDS IN THE SAVINJA VALLEY (1HPC AND 2HPC). NUCLEAR INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER (ITS) REGIONS OF RIBOSOMAL DNA (RDNA) WERE AMPLIFIED BY PCR ASSAY FROM TWO ISOLATES USING THE UNIVERSAL PRIMERS ITS4 AND ITS5, AND SEQUENCED. BOTH SAMPLES YIELDED A 781-BP SEQUENCE, WHICH SHOWED 100% IDENTITY TO H. CAMELINAE ITS SEQUENCE JX445136 IN GENBANK. THE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE WAS ASSIGNED TO GENBANK ACCESSION NO. KJ768405.

DOWNY MILDEW SYMPTOMS FIRST DEVELOPED ON LEAVES 6 DAYS AFTER INOCULATION. AN ADDITIONAL 25 CONTROL PLANTS SPRAYED WITH STERILIZED DISTILLED WATER AND OTHERWISE TREATED SIMILARLY TO THE INOCULATED PLANTS DEVELOPED NO SYMPTOMS. THE IDENTITY OF THE PATHOGEN ON THE INOCULATED PLANTS AS H. CAMELINAE WAS CONFIRMED BASED ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES DESCRIBED ABOVE. DOWNY MILDEW OF FALSE FLAX CAUSED BY H.

IN THIS MICROCOSM-BASED STUDY, SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO AMENDMENTS OF A GLUCOSINOLATE-CONTAINING BRASSICACEOUS OILSEED MEAL (BRASSICA JUNCEA, MUSTARD), A NON-GLUCOSINOLATE-CONTAINING, NONBRASSICACEOUS OILSEED MEAL (LINUM USITATISSIMUM, FLAX), AND A NONOILSEED BIOMASS (SORGHUM BICOLOR) WERE CHARACTERIZED USING A 28-DAY TIME SERIES OF REPLICATED 16S RRNA GENE AND FUNGAL ITS GENE SEQUENCE LIBRARIES. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT BIOMASS TYPE AND GLUCOSINOLATE CONTENT WOULD ALTER COMMUNITY COMPOSITION BUT THAT EFFECTS WOULD DIMINISH OVER TIME. DISTINCT SEPARATION OCCURRED BY AMENDMENT TYPE, WITH MUSTARD INDUCING LARGE INCREASES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF BACTERIAL TAXA ASSOCIATED WITH FUNGAL DISEASE SUPPRESSION (E.G. BACILLUS, PSEUDOMONAS, AND STREPTOMYCES SPP.). DRAMATIC SHIFTS WERE SEEN AMONG THE FUNGI, TOO, WITH PHYLOTYPE RICHNESS DECREASING BY > 60% FOLLOWING MUSTARD ADDITION. CHANGES IN BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WERE RAPID, AND DISTINCT COMMUNITY TYPES PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY. OILSEED AMENDMENT, AND MUSTARD IN PARTICULAR, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE SUBSTANTIALLY, AND SUCH CHANGES ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF ECOSYSTEM HEALTH.</p><h1>: DOI-10.1002/biot.201100105 Year: 2011</h1><p>MICROBIAL RETTING IS A CRITICAL STEP IN OBTAINING FIBER BUNDLES FROM BAMBOO CULM USING INDIGENOUS MICROORGANISMS. A CULTIVATION-INDEPENDENT TECHNIQUE FOR MONITORING THE CHANGES IN BACTERIA COMMUNITY DURING BAMBOO RETTING WAS APPLIED IN THIS WORK. THIS TECHNIQUE INVOLVES GENETIC PROFILING OF PCR-AMPLIFIED SMALL-SUBUNIT RRNA AND THE SINGLE-STRAND CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM (SSCP) GEL ANALYSIS OF THE PCR-AMPLIFIED 16S RDNA FRAGMENTS. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT BOTH THE STRUCTURE AND THE DIVERSITY OF INVESTIGATED COMMUNITIES VARIED WITH THE INCUBATION PERIODS AND SAMPLE LOCATIONS. THE BACTERIA BANDS FROM SCCP GEL PROFILES RELATED TO BACILLUS SP. DECREASED IN INTENSITY, AND PHAEOSPIRILLUM SP. AND AZOSPIRILLUM BRASILENSE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED DURING THE 4(TH) AND 5(TH) MONTH OF INCUBATION, WHILE THE BANDS RELATED TO THE SPHINGOMONAS JAPONICA, ALPHAPROTEOBACTERIUM ELLIN335 AND MICROBACTERIUM SP. INCREASED. THE BANDS CLOSELY RELATED TO SPHINGOMONADS, BREVUNDIMONAS BRASILENSE, PSEUDOCLAVIBACTER SP., AGROCOCCUS JENENSIS AND OXALOPHAGUS OXALICUS REMAINED DOMINANT DURING THE WHOLE INCUBATION PERIOD. THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THE USE OF PCR ASSAY TARGETING 16S RRNA AND SCCP PROFILING PROVIDED VALUABLE INFORMATION ON MONITORING THE BACTERIA DYNAMIC CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE BACTERIA COMMUNITY DURING BAMBOO RETTING, WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR CONTROLLING THE QUALITY OF THE RETTING PROCESS AND IMPROVING THE RETTING EFFICIENCY, AND THUS BENEFITS FOR FIBER RECOVERY.</p><h1>: DOI-NA Year: 1976</h1><p>BETWEEN DECEMBER 1, 1971, AND NOVEMBER 30, 1972, 11 PATIENTS ON A SINGLE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION WARD IN A LARGE ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, COMMUNITY HOSPITAL DEVELOPED PROTEUS RETTGERI URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS; P. RETTGERI ISOLATES FROM EACH PATIENT WERE INDOLE-NEGATIVE AND RESISTANT IN VITRO TO ALL ANTIBIOTICS TESTED. INFECTED PATIENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE INDWELLING URINARY TRACT CATHETERS THAN WERE MATCHED CONTROL PATIENTS, AND ALL HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY. RETROSPECTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGIC INVESTIGATION AND MICROBIOLOGIC SAMPLIG AT THE TIME OF THE INVESTIGATION FAILED TO DETECT A COMMON SOURCE OF INFECTION. INFECTED PATIENTS APPEARED TO BE THE MAJOR RESERVOIR OF THE EPIDEMIC STRAIN, AND INDIRECT-CONTACT TRANSMISSION OF THE ORGANISM VIA NURSING PERSONNEL PROBABLY OCCURRED. DATA COLLECTED FROM A PROSPECTIVE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT PLACING CATHETERIZED PATIENTS IN ROOMS THAT DID NOT CONTAIN OTHER CATHETERIZED PATIENTS MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE CONTROL MEASURE.</p>"""
